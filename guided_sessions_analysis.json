When we begin our meditations\nin Kriya Yoga, there is a set of techniques given to us to practice which will unfold\nthe inner man, the inner being. And we always\n01:37 - begin our sadhana, our spiritual practice,\nwith the OM technique. It's called the Omkar Kriya. I am now going to give you what is\ncalled the Omkar Kriya. You must remember that as I speak, my words will penetrate your\nheart and give you a healing transmission and a spiritual boost. My words will evolve\nyour inner emotional body, mental body and intuitional body. \nSo now, the first technique, which we call\n02:22 - the Omkar technique, is to do with Creation\nand how we reverse the process whereby we have come. All of you have heard of the Big\nBang Theory, that at the beginning of creation, there was the Word, and the Word was with\nGod and God was the Word. And that Word is Omkar. So Omkar itself is chanting God within\nyou. So it is a sacred word and the technique is very simple. I will explain to you, step\nby step. During the Omkar Technique, we take\n03:04 - a sacred, little room to ourselves, a meditation\nroom. If we do not have the meditation room, what we do is, we take a small corner and\nwe face the Eastern direction of the rising sun and we sit down to meditation. Those who\ncannot sit down to meditation can sit on a chair and insulate their feet with a blanket\nfacing the rising sun. And then sit in the aura of love. There's a good learning for\nus, that whatever the situation, whatever\n03:47 - the circumstances, that we must hold steadfast\nto our spiritual practice. We must be constant in our sadhana. And we must be constant in\nour devotion to God, whether it be through Bhajan, or Kirtan, which we call spiritual\ndiscourse and devotional chanting.",

Buy and download this same video for inspiration to keep on your computer or\nmobile device] [Filmed in Santa Rosa,CA USA  - August 23, 2008] Again I have to tell you,\nthe land, the only country in the world which got its independence by Peaceful means was\nIndia. And therefore we have been authorized to spread Earth Peace Through Self Peace through\nthe practice of Kriya Yoga. The person who\n00:55 - brought about peace through peaceful means,\nthe independence of India, was a great man called Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi [2 October\n1869 -- 30 January 1948]. This was a unique feature that there should be peace on earth\nand good will to all humankind. There should be earth peace but There can be no earth peace\nwithout self peace. The dynamic way to bring about self peace is by the practice of Kriya\nYoga. Kriya Yoga is a simple spinal breathing\n01:29 - which soothes the nerves and calms the mind\nat the first stage. At the second stage of Kriya Yoga which is very simple, everybody\nand anybody can do it, it brings about a transformation of your body cells. It slowly starts the process\nof retarding the aging process of the body cells. And the third advanced stages of the\npractice of Kriya Yoga arrests the aging process of your body cells by preventing mutation\nand growth. These are the phsyical benefits\n02:13 - of Kriya Yoga. [Pause] The Astral benefits\nare that it dilutes emotional suffering. By rythmic breathing, the emotions are calmed\nand stretched out. They're diluted by the constant practice of breathing and emotional\nsuffering is mitigated. The third and final thing is you get mental peace, when the mind\nis calm and still. Then you get to the last stage, when the mind is crystal clear. The\nmind dissolves unto itself. It lies subservient\n02:57 - and still without a ripple of thought. Then\nthe rising soul appears. Then the final stage: \"Stiller than stillness itself, with bated\nbreath I do behold, my rising self sun's nectar gold, I dissolve in that mystery untold. This\nis the beauty of Kriya Yoga. This is the splendor of Kriya Yoga. Practice Kriya Yoga. Do it\nnow.[Copyright й Hamsa Yoga Sanghо. All rights reserved]",

Buy and download this exact same video for inspiration to play on your computer\nor mobile device: [Opening Music Introduction]\n[Question] We have many opportunities to act, to give, to work. What guidance do you have\nto determine how you choose between a global effort or a local effort. How does one find\ngood works?\n00:37 - [Gurunath's Answer] Our first choice before\nanything else to avoid all confusion is God. We choose God first and then other things\nof relativity. The only purpose of Man's journey on this Earth is to seek God. So that's our\nfirst choice. And to seek God and to get to him the fastest\nway is to practice Kriya Yoga. Now there are other things which are irrelevant compared\nto God that choice you can make on your own.\n01:07 - How do you like that? Have I knocked off the\nconfusion in your mind? The only purpose of Man's sojourn on this Earth is to seek God.\nPeople doing anything else are wasting their time. \nDoes this ring harsh in your ears? The second thing you can do is your bread earning stuff.\nFirst seek God by your practice of Kriya Yoga, first choice. Second choice, put food on the\ntable. And third Choice. that's your... whatever\n01:53 - you want to do. You want to be working SeaWorld\nor Disneyland or working as Christiane Amanpour going as a press reporter in the battle areas\nor you want to work as a soldier in the United States Army, or you want to... that's your\nthird choice, and it doesn't really matter. If there's confusion in your mind, thank God,\ndon't do it, practice Kriya yoga. This is my simple way of thinking. Create God within\nyour being. He shall be your guiding light.\n02:30 - He shall be your beacon. A beacon of light\nthat shall guide you. Surrender to God first. Seek ye first the kingdom of God, then all\nthe other problems shall be solved and if they aren't who cares? Who cares oh Lord,\nas long as I have your light to guide me. Once I have thee, I shall want no more. Next\nquestion. That's the sort of answer you'll expect from a Yogi, any Yogi,\nwhat else do you expect? Be here for God,\n03:12 - live God, drink God, be God, love God, be\nsaturated with him so much that when you explode with him, you can explode with love. It appears\nso the good side is losing with all these guys\naggressing and terrorizing the Earth, but if it is his wish and will it will happen\nfor a certain time, the cloud will pass, then there will be peace and good will on Earth.\nLet us see what happens starting from 2008\n03:43 - to 2012. Let us see how things go. If you\npractice Kriya Yoga with patience, I promise you, starting with you yourself then a lot\nof things will progress for you. You will not get what you want if your practice Kriya\nYoga, you will get only what you need. So no ego balm, no pampering, no gizmos. And\nAmerica is the land of entertainment so you'll have to make a bit of sacrifice and lead the\nsimple life. Next question.\n04:34 - [Copyright й Hamsa Yoga Sanghо. All rights\nreserved]",

[Gurunath Speaking] \"the\nworld scenario\",[Hamsa speaking] \"the world scenario\" It's very easy looking at the world\nscenario of coming to the conclusion that things are getting worse \"YES\" rapidly. I\ndon't know it could be an illusion but it seems that way. When you look at that it seems\nto engender a feeling of um a ...anger. yeah\n00:49 - now, just... [Gurunath speaking] \"Righteous\nIndignation\" right, all kinds of very complex emotions which are not conducive to one's\nown peace. I wanted to ask you about, engaging, cleaning the toilets so to speak, and how\nto find that samadhi, find that connection.[Gurunath speaking] You have to be indifferent to the\nhappenings around you in the world and yet go on doing your work. If you are a Florence\nNightingale, go help the wounded soldiers,\n01:33 - heal their wounds, don't worry about what\nthe world is doing, you do your thing. If I am to give Earth Peace through Self Peace,\nI will not care if the Russian Troops go into Georgia, or whether they are remaining in\nMoscow, I will keep on transmitting Earth Peace through Self Peace. The rest we will\nleave in the hands of God. A great person has said that you cannot really change the\nworld. All you do by these great acts to help\n02:06 - the world, is to change yourself. But I go\non to say that one man who is changed is the cause of the existence of the world. One many\nlike the Buddha, the Christ or Krishna is the reason to be the \"raison d'être\" [meaning\n\"the most important reason why something exists, or the most important thing in someone's life.\"]\nSo why is this enlightened person the cause of the reason for us to be? Because he has\nsacrificed himself in love and spread his\n02:43 - love to all humanity. Although on the surface\nof it, those who are aggressive, those who are terrorists will still carry on with their\nterrorist activities. You see one terrorist can upset a million people by his act but\nwe are not to be upset, not to be shaken in our faith for the good Lord shall prevail.\nHis peace shall prevail. This is not talk. This is a fact. These are times, where before\nthe coming of the Kalki, these things have\n03:21 - been predicted that humanity will run a muck\nto a certain extent. But there are those who meditate amongst us, who will keep the anchor\nof peace and love flowing through the veins of humanity. Breathing through their breath.\nThat is you dear souls, and all such people like us who meditate and practice the Kriya\nYoga or any other form of yoga. It is because of your valor, your courage that human beings\nwill survive. We shall not become extinct.\n03:54 - It is because of people who are meditating,\nsouls like you that there will be no extinction. This is the way to do it and to be impervious\nto it, to surrender all your anger all your negativity at the feet of the Lord and say\ngive me strength to practice the Kriya Yoga. You have to have something strong, like Kriya\nYoga to practice ceaselessly and know that with every breath you are creating God within\nyour spine. By the practice of Kriya Yoga,\n04:24 - with every breath you are creating God within\nyou.

          "title": "The Science of Kriya Yoga",
          "transcript": "00:09 - [Filmed during the 2010 Tour, Los Angeles,\nCA USA] [Learn Kriya Yoga from Himalayan Master Yogiraj Siddhanath] [Music by Shivraj] So\nI don't want you to be much in the head, so I'm going to shift you to the heart. You can\nkeep your head for the office and keep your heart when you truly like to do what you're\ndoing. Because you can intuit the higher realms of your being, by being in the heart. You\ncan intuit the higher realms of your being,\n00:43 - by being in the heart. This is true. The Science\nof Kriya Yoga, I will explain to you briefly, is the science of life force control. The\ncontrol of the life force energy which sustains the human body. It is called prana, the original\nword is prana. Many of you see that people have taken the Sanskrit word of prana and\ncalled it pranic healing which is originally an Indian technique. It was born in India,\noriginated in India and today you shall feel\n01:22 - the movement of this prana as I project and\naware this prana into each one of you, depending, according to your receptivity, to the degree\nof your harmony with me, your tuning in. So Kriya Yoga is a simple science of breathing\nwhereby the initial stages, you soothe your nerves and calm your mind. And after this\nhas been achieved if you further practice, it gives you a tremendous inner peace. And\nif you further go deeper in the practice,\n01:53 - that peace flowers into bliss. And if you\nstill persist year after year and life after life, in that practice, the bliss flowers\ninto the likeness of your own divinity. So when your focus and when you practice and\ncontemplate on the breath of life, prana is the breath of life, it's not the physical\nbreath, but it's the life force energy, the breath of life. When you focus on the breath\nof life in your spine, you tend to evolve\n02:26 - steadily the consciousness within you. So\nyou begin to live more and more in consciousness and less and less in your physical body. From\nyour physical body, by the practice of inner quiet, as you quiet your mind, you tend to\nbe more aware of your emotions. As you further practice Kriya Yoga, and refine the septenary\nman that you are, you become more and more aware of your mind process. As you keep practicing\nmore and more, you become less conscious of\n03:04 - your body and more conscious of your intellect,\nand as you practice more, you become more conscious of your intuition and the intuition\nis the tube, the transit system from the finite soul to the Infinite God. From the finite\nconsciousness to the Infinite Consciousness, the universal Divinity which is the true nature\nof your being. Your physical body is just the tip of the iceberg. And believe you me,\nby the constant practice of this science,\n03:37 - it is not religion or a creed, it is non-denominational,\nit contradicts no religion or creed, it only helps you to do what you are already doing\nbetter. It is said in the ancient scriptures of the East, like the Bhagavad Gita, and the\nKalki Purana that those who ingest good health and a lot of sunlight, those who practice\nthe technique of Kriya Yoga, [a.k.a.] the \"technique of Bioluminescence\" like a plant\nhas photosynthesis, so you dear souls, have\n04:16 - have the process of bioluminescence, whereby\nKriya Yoga, you can absorb the light and energy in your bodies and live a happy life, override\nthe crisis situation and not fall into any mishap or premature accidents. Because the\nshield of light, the shield of Kriya Yoga, the shield of Surya that is the sunlight,\nshall protect you and keep you from harm's way. With this I conclude my talk about Kriya\nYoga. If you want to know what Kriya Yoga\n04:48 - is in detail and you would like to see me\nbreathing through your breath and assisting you, you must come in the evening, 7-9, when\nI will be practicing and uniting all of us with the self same cord of breath. So it is\nnot only a talk, I'm actually giving it to the reception, to the people who receive,\npeople who are in harmony with me, who attune with me, I will give them the experience of\npranapat, breathing my breath through your\n05:15 - breath, and thereby showing to you that Humanity\nis tied by the self same cord of breath through love. It's high time we experience it. Enough\nof reading the menu. Let's taste the food, from 7-9. It's a gourmet I tell you. [Laughter].",

technique which I am going to teach you and initiate you into as the first onar Kaa it's called the onar k y the first Omar Kaa and because it is of such vital\n01:24 - importance because we are all floating in the soup of the vibration of the Omar in the Christian World they call it the great\n01:38 - amen you know like they they [Music] saying they say it is tast or so be it but it is the sound I call it the birthing hum of creation when the\n01:59 - Great deep the great primordial energy called the M PR orti Amba the primordial energy gives birth to\n02:14 - Creation the sound of the birthing of the billions of stars and galaxies and nebula makes the sound [Laughter]\n02:29 - oh in today's Times in the modern ages they have actually recorded the sound of creation many of you if you go to the computer you will see that NASA has\n02:44 - given a certain sound how many of you have heard the sound it's like a oh raise your hands and the computer you hear the sound it's the sound of the instant creation so I'm I'm bringing\n02:57 - this before you because I'm not teaching you any religion or faith I'm teaching you yourself The Source from where you originated the source in which you live and move and have your being and the\n03:11 - source to which you shall return is the great sound called the OM in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and God was the word\n03:31 - so even in ancient texts and scriptures they give you the importance of the sound of om God in the beginning of time there was\n03:45 - neither causation space no time the laws of physics did not hold good all was the great unfathomable deep [Music]\n04:05 - yes I heard you mention that um Ganesh is the centrifugal force of the universe is that because the expansion [Music] yes that's half the story they had asked\n04:21 - me in the beginning what is the symbology of Ganesh and K and when I was in the himal at guptakashi in the Himalayas are facing\n04:33 - the karath mountain this is the thing I I I wrote down that Ganesh is the uh when these two children they explode from the womb of their mother that is parti Amba that is Amika the Amba means\n04:51 - the great unfathomable deep when they explode and the outering centrifugal force represents Ganesha it's the scientific evaluation of what I think it to be and K who took\n05:05 - an who rounded up the whole creation by going on his peacock he encircled the whole creation Ganesh spun around himself and created waves which went\n05:16 - outwards kti went to the outermost far limits of the mind and matter of the universe and collected and and created a Vortex which brought back the ripples to the center so ganes the centrifugal\n05:30 - force of creation and kti is the centripetal force of creation I know this is not written in the Holy Bible or in the bhagad Gita or in the Quran but I'm open to to to criticism or I'm open\n05:44 - to to people learning from me or me learning from them so I have put this forward because it's high time that we went from Voodoo and aabra and uh to to to scientific stuff\n05:58 - scientific knowledge that's to why the Indian Yogi is the first scientist of creation 20 30,000 years ago he created his body as the laboratory and his\n06:12 - breath his his rational mind and his intuitive mind as the two lab assistants and he worked upon the laboratory of his own body to discover that behold there is the Divine envelope\n06:29 - with there is God within me this is the great contribution of India to the world and had India nothing to offer to the world I'm\n06:42 - quoting from Gana [Music] yukar had India nothing to offer to the whole world K yog itself would suffice as a kingly offering\n07:00 - this is our valuable PR yogas so this is they worked in the laboratory of their own body and they discovered that there is God within our body and then the Great openads and the\n07:13 - VAS rang out and their golden voice with diamond studed words that Behold a man you are of God you are Divine you\n07:28 - are not a corruptible body but a Divine soul and there is the pathway to get to express this Divinity and that pathway is called yog K yog is just the lightening path and an\n07:46 - aspect of yog and the ancient Ries and the sages of the fire Mist proclaimed that just like there is Tinder in the fire\n08:01 - you rub the Tinder and the fire manifests there is oil in the seed you squeeze the seed and the oil manifests there is butter in the milk you churn the milk and the butter\n08:15 - manifests so also there is God in man you breathe the man and God manifests and this breathing process is called the Divine Kaa yog which is very scientific\n08:30 - yet has its roots in the soils of Love Without which the science part of it cannot flow so it's a well balanced technique of the left and right brain of science that is rationality and\n08:47 - [Music] love [Music] CH sh",

from us what is K yog what is B's let me simplify is your\n01:07 - vegetarianism or eating only salads and lettuce and detoxin the body and thinking that because I'm a vegan I'm superior to all no it is not vegetarianism although\n01:20 - that by itself is a good thing I'm predominantly vegetarian but if eating lettuce and grass for the main object then all the cows would be in life\n01:35 - is there many people in India you see these old ladies they do their breath and they have a bath morning and evening and they say so we ask them our granes and all why you having so much bath and\n01:44 - all they cleanliness is next next to God so then if it were having a bath then all the fish would be enlightened which they not so there are many misconceptions about yoke these are\n01:58 - minor facilities which help the main process of yog but or physical postures oh she does the vishas so well in this thing if physical postures and hat yog as they wrongly\n02:15 - call it which is kast yog postular integration for yog then Nadia konich would be the greatest Yogi in the world she's the one who got a perfect the first Romanian gymnast who got a perfect\n02:28 - 10 in the Olympics you know that I I then if you know that surprising they say okay what is yog they say I'm doing Zen and when you\n02:44 - go to do yog they did the disgrace it has been fallen from grace to a mere physical postures this is the least of what yog is this is the least of what yog is it's only 1/8 of a portion of\n03:02 - yog yog is an inner asent it's an inner asent through ever more refined and ever more expanded spheres of\n03:18 - mind to get to the god Essence the Divine Consciousness which lies at the core of your own being as the Great Sage and divine master of\n03:34 - all Masters who we honor today at the gurup he has said Y yog is nothing less than a Divine State of at onement with\n03:55 - God yog is an ecstasy of expanded Consciousness B of thought devoid of breath no thought no breath y when they ask you what yog is it's nothing less\n04:10 - than that total fusion with God total Fusion of the Soul with the spirit is yog then what is Zen what is sator Zen Satori are first later additions firstly there's no such thing\n04:26 - as Zen it is mispronounced it is called it came from India thousands of years ago it came from India it's called danan which means a meditation then it went to China it\n04:41 - migrated and was called Chan when bodhidharma from India went to China and established the shaoling temple 300 ad the bodh Dharma is an Indian Sage from Kiam South India but the real\n05:00 - practitioners are buried in the Snows in the Himalayan caves if you go to India so lofty are those beings that they take the pain and cancer and AIDS of people and die in the Snows without a song\n05:12 - being sung about them they don't know if they eist they're just melting love such Mighty beings and many a\n05:26 - flower has blossomed to blood unseen and many a flower has blossomed to blush unseen and wasted its fragrance in the desert SS these Heroes went\n05:45 - unsung but did they yes in human eyes yes but in the eyes of the Divine Lord God no they the dims they the diamonds of his heart\n06:01 - and if we should on our path to yog the greatest obstacle reduce which is ego we shall surely enter the Divine State of Consciousness till then it is\n06:17 - difficult getting back to the subject of K yog which I'm going to initiate you into believe me in all my 60 years I have practiced every type of meditation every type of yoga every type of\n06:30 - and I've come to the conclusion that this simple process of Kaa yoke which is pronic breathing in the spine with an attitude of\n06:46 - Love is called the lightning path it is simple Dynamic and effective therefore I make an appeal to you scientifically please practice this yoke and transform your life into nectar\n07:08 - gold it takes you into a beautiful state everyone experiences and has to go to that state of divin but the ultimate state is always unknown because the mind is a t Tin Care our minds are resty Tin\n07:24 - Can compared to the Splendor of the Lord then when all the junk and POS the junkyard of the mind has been left behind what happens in K yog what is the\n07:39 - inner State then Stiller than Stillness itself then Stiller than Stillness itself with baited breath I do behold then Stiller than Stillness\n07:56 - itself with baited breath I do behold my Rising self Sun's nectar gold I dissolve in that mystery Untold this dear Souls is the state of\n08:20 - samadi whether you know it or not whether you realize it or not the only purpose of your being Earth is to seek God all other things are secondary\n08:36 -

right yeah now it is not my place or position to\n01:34 - talk about any other master since he was a beloved master to me like a master till i met babaji most uh and he we were very close\n01:45 - to what hari and ananda taught and let me tell you we taught the very simple technique initially and later started teaching this reasons for which i do not know it's given on the youtube that i\n01:55 - told him baba these are the difficulties people find it very difficult i cannot teach these techniques because he wanted me to be the leader of the whole movement of the householder\n02:05 - yogis so he said teach i said baba why cannot carry on teaching the techniques which lahiri mahasaya taught and which they sure\n02:22 - so he said yes you do that because he was also a disciple of sri youth along with so i carried on teaching the simple techniques which were taught by lahiri\n02:32 - mahasaya by babaji today this is what i'm teaching the reason for my teaching techniques and trying to make them simpler and simpler is that you don't get\n02:51 - caught in the spaghetti of the mind if techniques are too complicated they give you analysis paralysis and this is my simple logic that may be\n03:03 - wrong i'm not trying to impose if you if i give you a mantra you won't be able to pronounce it so i spent six months sharpening your trunks\n03:23 - okay now if you say like a word like so this is the difficulty okay do you understand the difficulty so the simpler i make it for you the\n03:54 - easier it is for your consciousness to slip out of your mind the easier it is for you to make the technique your second nature and for your\n04:06 - the technique to be your second nature the technique must be as simple as the smile of a child the technique must be as simple as cycling which then too is a little complicated\n04:20 - the technique must be a technique must be as simple as breathing so there are complicated techniques i have nothing to say they are very effective and very nice why he chose to\n04:33 - to do this it may be an addish from his great guru lahiri mahasaya or from babaji shiva means the auspicious one shiva means the divinity of the consciousness\n04:47 - of the life of your breath shiva is not a god or a greed or a religion or a cult it is the divinity of the consciousness of the life of your breath\n04:60 - that's what it means it's your core essence and therefore you must practice the sacred word which liberates you from the bondage of delusion illusion\n05:12 - and error and therefore i try to make my techniques as simple as possible very simple the time is running out make haste\n05:35 - for the stars are setting and the caravan starts for the dawn of nothing make hist a famous spoiler said that most probably\n05:50 - it is it is uh i think it's in the rubbish oh it it's one of the truth\n06:04 - one moment in annihilation's waste one moment of the well of life to taste the stars are setting and the caravan starts for the dawn of nothing\n06:19 - or make haste so this dawn of nothing is not perceived by the western mind they want things money name fame ferraris\n06:35 - friends but they don't understand that the stars are setting and the caravan starts for the dawn of nothing or make haste\n06:47 - because the dawn of nothing is god he is indescribable therefore he is called the dawn of nothing he cannot be described in words one moment in annihilation's waste\n07:02 - one moment of the well of life to taste the stars are setting and the caravan starts for the dawn of nothing o make haste\n07:16 - don't keep sleeping and having me wake you up every morning don't miss the dawn of nothing because the dawn of everything\n07:31 - is beset with delusion illusion and error it's only in the it's only the purity of the dawn of nothing which will give you eternal bliss\n07:42 - for the stars are setting and the caravan starts for the dawn of nothing or make haste the idea is to touch\n07:57 - some untouched corner of your heart and be and arrive and and awaken within you that\n08:07 - that nostalgic perfume which takes you to the land beyond description whose joy is ineffable i can't get over the bad habit of talking directly about god and spirit\n08:28 - and not coming and relating with you at the level of matter and social security that your government should do for you that you should do for yourself take\n08:40 - care of your own karma make your own formula but do not forget the pathway to god for he is the truth and ever shall be with this i conclude today salsa\n08:55 - god bless godspeed [Music] she foreign [Music]\n09:34 - [Music] [Music] no",

persistent in constantly giving love to friends and foes alike the greatest weapon which you have is to shatter\n00:42 - hatred with love you must radiate love for Earth peace through self- Peace So when you have acquired self- peace you can radiate Earth peace and if you continuously radiate like the sun people\n00:57 - are bound to feel happy they bound to feel the warmth the mighty spiritual son and that's why we give you a technique called the sua yog have you done this sidat sua yoke\n01:09 - because since I'm the originator of this and it is my service to you I serve you by giving you this technique of the sun where and he is our the god of Kaa yog The First Kaa Yogi the Sun\n01:23 - vivat the great Manu today we will use this the s Surya the energy for the practice of Kaa yog and I'm going to teach you the third technique which is called the nabii Kaa\n01:41 - or the nabo Kaa which is to do with steadying your Consciousness in your Naval Center you see the pran is divided into five major sections the pran by which\n01:58 - which sustains you and gives you your spiritual emotional and mental and physical Vigor and livelihood is the pran the main pran is divided into pran upon saman Udan and\n02:12 - bean so the main pran being in the Heart Center gives you your life and livingness your eyess your lust and love for life so it assimilates the livingness\n02:26 - and the life of the Sun the upon is a subsection of the pran which eliminates all toxins from your body like excreta sweat urine um uh negative uh uh emotions and\n02:45 - negative Karma so when you go down with Shiva Shakti you're incinerating your negative and evil karma please have this in mind that you're incinerating you're burning your\n02:56 - negative Karma as you go down in the pranayam as you come up you're evolving human consciousness see it's so beautiful it's to do with nothing of the world it's directly to do\n03:04 - with you because you are the Crown Jewel of the Lord God Your Soul Essence is directly connected to God and you have his Birthright the only thing you're washing\n03:17 - away the mud of the mind which covers the Splendor of your soul by the practice of cria yog techniques called the lightning path\n03:33 - so pran assimilates gives you life and livingness gives you divine Evolution upon eliminates the second current of the chi of the the the pran it eliminates pran upon then saman\n03:47 - equalizes your mind body mind and soul and keeps you in equilibrium and balance it helps you to find your Center Naval heart third eye transpersonal point that is saman pran\n04:03 - that technique which we are doing so we're dealing with all the energy systematically can you see how systematically this process is proceeding the technique of K yog\n04:12 - studied through thousands of years these are time tried then is Udan which is at the throat which deals with the metabolic threshold and the metabolic balance of all your endocrine system\n04:27 - your treasure box your your medicine box which is is in your body the yogi says your the human body itself is a medicine box you don't have to go to to herbs and cilantro and rosemary and eonian chamir\n04:44 - if you if you do the purest form of of treatment is the medicine box within your own human body then comes eating raw leaves and vegetables and all secondary that's not\n04:55 - the best because it's external this is direct sunlight and working on the medicine chest of your own body you can immortalize the physical emotional mental and spiritual bodies yogis have\n05:06 - done it before they can do it now and they give you hope even if you cannot rejuvenate and they reverse the aging process you can at least it reversing the aging process doesn't mean\n05:16 - you you suddenly become a thumb a toe sucking baby in 6 months and you reverse yourself you become a toe sucking baby you go into your mother's womb and then you go into the astral and spiritual\n05:26 - spheres and there you lie at rest it's not like that it's not it is your mind and body are re are reversed to a state of Perfect Light where light is held in suspended\n05:40 - animation so now these are the five functions of the five PRS the fravashis as they call it the pran the fravashi the chi the life force energy as they say in English the five\n05:54 - life force energies and we are dealing with the equilibrium life force energy equanimity the constancy so when you practice this how will the yogi be how will you be if\n06:05 - you sincerely practice this what will your temperament what will your nature be in joy and sorrow light and dark you ever that Eternal spark in honor and\n06:21 - dishonor too you constant Yogi ever knew so you will be very very steady so people will love you for what you are without seeing anything you have to\n06:38 - be steadfast he sons of Light delusion fight be constant in your days and nights so constancy is a very very important factor and this is what Kaa\n06:50 -

          "title": "May 2018 Full Moon Blessings",
          "transcript": "00:05 - welcome everybody to the full moon all my blessings are with you today I shall talk to you and give you a very simple exposition of how your mind stuff which is in reality the collective mind how\n00:29 - your mind stuff can be evolved into consciousness so your mind stuff is like leading the dough there's a lump of dough at this organized mind you take a rolling pin take some dough take a\n00:55 - rolling pin and begin to roll the dough and ultimately chapatis are formed so now Here I am comparing the rolling pin to the breath of Kriya oh and I'm saying that the dough is the mind stuff so when\n01:15 - the dough is very opaque and very gross it is considered to be the lower or the passional mind the sensual mind the mind involved in the senses and when you start doing the prana of Kriya yoga the\n01:38 - mind gets more and more refined by gradual practice by chuttan rather means taking the effort to achieve a certain result sustained practice is Jotham so when you\n01:60 - ceaselessly practice the career you you're essential mind becomes more refined it takes shape and the central mind becomes the emotional mind as you keep practicing creates like taking the\n02:16 - rolling pin and rolling it and getting the thick formless shapeless dough into a particular form and as you use the rolling pin you refine the mind you refine the dough and as you keep\n02:37 - practicing on the rolling pin is your kriya breath the mind stuff is the dough and as with the rolling pin of the breath you churn the mind stuff of the dough the dough becomes a cleanser\n02:53 - cleanser till it becomes very very thin and refined so your sensual mind becomes your emotional mind as you practice Kriya yoga your emotional mind becomes your devotional mind and your devotional\n03:08 - mind becomes your intellectual a boutique mind intellectual mind and your intellectual mind becomes your intuitional mind if Arjun radians the mind it is turned into\n03:23 - by the constant practice of Kriya Yoga is just like when you do a rolling pin and you keep rolling the dough it becomes a chapati you keep rolling it further the chapati become so thin that\n03:35 - if you dig it up it becomes transparent chapati is the unleavened bread round unleavened bread you see from where support I presume the word ciabatta comes the Italian word ciabatta bread\n03:49 - from chapati chapati so what I have tried to emphasize today do you all in very simple languages be constant and regular in your practice don't know 200 Ria's what day and then\n04:08 - message was in three layers and then do 76 keep a regular 76 or 144 Kriya whatever time permits dedicate yourself to that practice whatever your thoughts may wander wherever they may wander keep\n04:26 - your practice regular let the thoughts wander they will come into controlled by the mind so practice is the secret of success and as you as you knead the dough and then use the rolling pin on\n04:41 - the door so with your concentration and the regular practice of Kriya breath you can refine your mind to such a degree that it becomes a molecular mind and then an atomic mind and then a subatomic\n04:60 - mind then it can become an electric protonic mind and then the proton also goes with it dies the Evo it becomes the electronic mind which is pure intuition and that reflects the Atma the\n05:17 - consciousness so your electronic mind is your is the butit mind and it is so crystal clear the bearer of truth that mind is the return ba remaining and that electronic mind of so crystal clear that\n05:33 - the athma consciousness is reflected in your boutique mind and the booty mistakes itself to be the Atma this is where the heresy of mistaken identity happens now people say by constant\n05:51 - practice the body which is made of pure electron sattva it's so pure it reflects the Alpha when the body becomes as pure as the Atma it releases the Atma to merchants Parma\n06:10 - know what I have to say and which the other way be done Advaita philosophy agrees with that where as soon as the effulgent radiance of the mind becomes as pure as the Atma consciousness as\n06:34 - soon as the boutique mind becomes as pure as the anthemic consciousness the Atma consciousness takes into its fold the boutique mind if then becomes Atma consciousness and with the Buddha mind\n06:47 - the ahmed consciousness merges into the Paramatma which is the supreme consciousness the super consciousness so these are ways the highest form of practice is the practice by breath where\n07:04 - you can be regular and constant and dedicated because by constant practice you develop the wake which is in CERN mint where you can insert your false body and mind from the true Ahmed soul\n07:23 - you can discern that you are not the boutique mind but you are the ethnic consciousness and that's where the whole game lies but after you have distinguished from that and you keep\n07:38 - practicing even that that would the mind becomes very very pure can be assimilated into the Atma so everything merges into the divine this is what I teach this is what my\n07:56 - conviction is and this is what I have experienced Oh",

          "transcript": "00:01 - [Music] [Applause] [Music] in the Bas the gri along with the mahab batra these are the\n00:27 - two Bas which are very very spiritual and very powerful but uh if you read carefully you will understand in the life of Mahar mahasaya he practiced gatri mantra for\n00:45 - 28 years after that he went into Kaa Baba gave him the K so what does this mean if Kya was the highest Baba would say keep doing that if gatri Mantra was\n01:00 - the highest he would say keep doing that he said no you had you got to speed up now and then he gave him the K may this example be noted tell to the Western World who have gone crazy on\n01:15 - chanting the gatri Mantra without the proper pronunciation they be told the case of liar mahasaya after 28 years of practice of G he was given the prya Yoke by sh gor shabaj this shows that that\n01:30 - that the Kaa yog is definitely more effective and powerful than the gri Mantra but a Kaa yog is a very deeply initiated process whereas the gri of the West is given part by anyone to\n01:44 - anyone so it holds no water to evolve the human being and the rapidity at which K yok even if correctly said gatri is a BNA the Tria yog is the movement of your very life\n02:00 - Essence it includes the gatri includes the mahab manra the very fact you're doinga it includes the gatri and the mahab and in the form of breath\n02:16 - sound and spiritual ener why is the Crea yog more powerful and Swifter than the gatri Mantra the K yog is more powerful and swifter than the gatri Mantra the\n02:36 - gatri Mantra is very important it involves a concentration it it involves some and it involves uh the sound vibrations of the M\n02:52 - but K yog the Shiva Shakti Kaa is PR itself and PR itself at it what does it involve it [Music] involves the sexual fluid the\n03:08 - procreative vital fluid it involves the breath it involves the life force energy and it involves the Mind itself when these things intertwine they make a certain powerful force going up the\n03:25 - spine called the energy and therefore the K yog is the most powerful way and the lightning path to get to God it is the most powerful way\n03:41 - at the lightning path to merge your individual Consciousness with the universal Consciousness most powerful way to unite Jaa with\n03:53 - Shiva and the finite with the infinite God essence I hope this is uh like we drill a b well we have have to drill a passage into your because the skull is protecting\n04:12 - your brain so when I drill it through your skull I hope this is suck in your mind I hope I've drilled it sufficiently clear that K yog is the crema CR of all sadas you see from the procreative fluid\n04:27 - to your breath to your life force energy to your mind that's practically everything and that is good that's why she is known as the mother of all creation that's another form of the\n04:39 - Goddess herself instead of using the Mantra instead of chanting the Mantra you're using it you know instead of chanting the goddess you're moving with the goddess to get to\n04:52 - God right so the the the the breath of the life force of k yog f The Embers of BU and then the lady of the Cinders Cinderella she arises from the flames\n05:09 - and the Embers rushing up the chimney of the spine to beat her prince charming at sahastra the Thousand FAL and then Enlightenment is your name Enlightenment is your\n05:24 - name this is this is a PR poetry so I I usually don't talk English I break into poetry and fro poetry because then it it hits you with a Maximum Impact and once it h hits you at\n05:40 - the Maximum Impact then you don't you don't miss the point that if I were to do nothing else but only sha shaki Kaa I would reach the goal or if I were to do nothing else but do the\n05:52 - Kaa listening to the sound of God and bathe in the vibrations of God that too would get me to a very higher stage because Kaa begins where all the mantras end the subit substance of all\n06:08 - the mantras in the universe are contained in the I so if the very first Tria is starting with Omar it shows that Tri Tri begins\n06:23 - where all the Bas all the Bas whether it be I okay all these beas are summed up in Omar so when you start with the technique you're already above the Bas\n06:38 - and you started at a higher level hitting the D of the head every time but then to you see we have a certain section of our people our teachers who are able to they said okay gun we have\n06:53 - no argument with you as long as pure spirituality is concerned but the world is not purely spiritual they are material minded so we should be able to give some other auxiliary Manas\n07:05 - you know like for headache or spinal pain because after all a human being so in order to make them to get to pra mantras which cure or Inspire or help to diminish their desires they give a for\n07:20 - wealth once he starts getting that wealth like K said I want this that will get it so now he's got that Lottery and uh because he was trying to test me so I said okay take it because those things\n07:33 - are very meaningless they don't they are very useful we respect them as far as our organization is is uh there and to put up but uh we should have both should have but we personally should understand\n07:49 - in our heart of hearts that the desire of all desires is God hiding camouflage behind every smile behind every sex act behind every pray behind every devotion behind every\n08:03 - samadi is the true essence of God [Music]",

mind into positive life energy growth when you move the breath of Kriya yoga in your spinal cord behind your vertebrae there is a string tennis neuron like thing called the sushumna\n03:49 - nadi the spinal cord within which is the sushumna nadi Sushma namah when you move the breath in this channel it is a process of Kriya yoga what does the bread do when it moves in the spinal it\n04:09 - contacts certain astral plexus known as the pranic lotuses known as the chakras and when it passes through the chakras it nullifies your negative karma along with bodily disease mental disease of\n04:32 - stress intention emotional suffering is or transformed to positive life energy growth because holding your astral chakras is the DNA each individual has his own set of genomes his DNA in the\n04:56 - DNA DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid so say the scientists but that is only a shadow of the pranic chakras which are the true source the vortex of energy which linked the spiritual to the\n05:14 - material so when these chakras had generated a house made a house for themselves called the DNA now the DNA has on it what is called nitrogen nums\n05:33 - for nitrogen nums they like tape recorders and they film it's like a DVD like in Europe they say devout day so it's a devout day which records all your past deeds and actions nobody can escape\n05:51 - from it you know if you're saying I'm a great dietician and going to the night to your fridge and eating the best of chocolates it's all recorded in the DNA the day of our day and it's not only an\n06:04 - audio cassette it's a the damn problem is that it's a DVD so so if I sit like this and from my projector I project my DVD you can see on the screen my whole life story of past present and future\n06:22 - now the Kriya breath that's the great divine genius of gamma J what does the Kriya bread do the Kriya breath while moving through the spinal cord and go not how do we make the breath move\n06:39 - through the spinal cord by intent there's a saying in yogic Palance jihad check the baha brawn jihad check the waha pran wherever the concentrated mind is there the pran should be so as you\n06:56 - move your pran concentrating in the narrow pathway the pilgrims progress in the spinal cord this bread the Stronach life energy rubs out the tape on the DNA the tape recorder can\n07:13 - rubbed out and nullified that's why this is a dynamic process and a very scientific process that's why the oldest tradition in the world is the tradition of the Siddhas they transfer Buddhism\n07:31 - they strand of Jainism they straddle the Yogi's of the Garhwal Himalayas and older than the Sedna tradition are the elite of the signals were ever immortal called the not Yogi's not sinners the\n07:43 - signals now this oldest of tradition wanted to expound this technique this dynamic process of evolution the evolution of spiritual consciousness to the west they\n08:06 - fell therefore they had to take some body somebody put in it some soul of a yogi they put in this body my soul given me this body it's okay I've got a broken leg and a cracked up skull not much\n08:20 - brains but they made a useful guy out of this body and he has to relate and translate to them a digital scientific language before he goes to the devotional language so when there's\n08:36 - breath moves in the DNA it has a frictional action on the DNA that is the life energy and the DNA create a friction and by this friction the Karma how many of you have know I've heard of\n08:59 - the word karma raise your hand yeah but now I'm going to tell you how the Karma where it is lodged and how it can be dissolved which none of the techniques here tell you for 60 years plus I've\n09:17 - done yoga nothing you and I into all the systems and everywhere and that's where the genius of homogenized that this is the only technique which can dissolve your negative karma pappu\n09:31 - has McGurk a nob Jeevan Jyoti Jyoti javadi it burns your past evil Karma's and creates a new life awakening in you new life awakening this is what the kriya you does it's very important to\n09:48 - understand this that it's a dynamic process of the evolution of spiritual consciousness it is very simple the more absorption the more concentration you do it with the more you will be absorbed\n10:05 - that means the more concentration you will do it the more you will slip into meditation meditation cannot be done I hear people say here I am going to meditate I'm going to do this I'm going\n10:15 - to do that you cannot meditate I am going to open the flower this is a beautiful god of a sunflower or below of a lotus or a rose I'm gonna open it no no you you have to\n10:27 - water the plant and the flower will open itself otherwise you'll break the petals I are so you got meditate nobody can meditate meditation happens as a result of concentration\n10:43 - concentration is the practice of spiritual growth you must know it if the word is called sadhana sadhana is the practice of spiritual growth",

          "transcript": "00:01 - today I'm going to start by giving you a technique called the Omar Kaa in Christianity it is called the great\n00:15 - amen means so be it in the Islamic world it is called Aman but India is the only place where we went deep into this world of the glorification of the Divine\n00:38 - how God can be glorified how the soul can be glorified that's what the word amen or om om means the glorification of the Lord and therefore the whole creation begins with the\n00:57 - word but when it started at the beginning of time it was a light sound it was light sound and it came with a big explosion the explosion theory was known\n01:16 - way before the West the Western World knew the Big Bang the Big Bang started with the Omar the Omar exploded into existence not the beginning of creation and time there was a huge there was a\n01:36 - small Essence a particle smaller than the nucleus of an atom a small particle an Essence a spiritual Essence which came from nowhere which\n01:52 - came into being with a tremendous light sound this is known the technique I'm teaching you is the great Omar it is known as the sound of the instant\n02:08 - creation the spiritual world word which all of you chant Amen in churches and this thing without knowing what you're chanting I'm analyzing and expounding the import\n02:23 - of the Sacred word of Omar the amen smaller than the nucleus of an atom compressed with this small seed light sound this photonic sound is contained the whole\n02:43 - universe it is very difficult for you to imagine it is impossible to contain the whole earth in a cup of tea you can't shrink the whole world into a cup of tea it'll be so dense that it'll fall to\n02:57 - Eternity yeah we talking about shrinking the whole whole expanded universe into smaller than nucleus of an atom it is impossible for us to conceive it is beyond human comprehension and\n03:14 - thought but for the Lord God nothing is impossible nothing is impossible so this small sound which was the sound of the instant\n03:28 - creation which burst into relativity from reality this sound burst into relativity the great light sound and the light preceded The Sound by aons of millions of\n03:45 - years and so when the seed sound exploded within a billionth of a second it became almost as big as our present universe I have to tell you these things these\n04:03 - are the secrets of the Lord I'm telling you how about God came into being and how God expanded into the universe so I know you can't do it in a billionth of a second but I'm sure God you know that\n04:15 - God can do it I because that's why God is God and so this expansion continued in permutation combinations over eons of billions of\n04:28 - years and first there were a huge just the light which lay for millions of years in the Still Waters of space creating a ripple effect as it expanded through the seven eternities of space\n04:44 - see God is Big so I have to talk big I can't talk in small photons and all I have to talk in eternities okay and one eternity is not enough seven eternities were\n04:59 - required and they expanded and therefore the potential energy the potential Stillness became the dynamic energy of creation which we in sanatan Dharma in India we call\n05:17 - Shakti the feminine aspect went into Dynamic creation that's the mother of the great deep we call the mother ambas Amba the great deep the vastest expression for this in\n05:32 - the Christian language is a mother of the star vault which they they address the Virgin Mary as our mother the Lady Fatima addressed as the mother of the star\n05:43 - Vault and so the light came and raised over vast tracks of the unknowingness of Eternal spaces in the sky is infinite and then gradually by\n05:58 - permutation combination you know this was the first the Big Bang had not happened the sonic boom had not happened as yet it was only the optic\n06:11 - boom so when light became slower from an infinite speed it came into this optic boom it was silent only the sonic boom is the Big Bang which is millions of years of later the sound came like here\n06:24 - in a miniature you see when when lightning strikes first you see the lightning and then a few seconds later is the sound but for creation it's many millions of years\n06:34 - later and then vast incandescent Vapors covers the spaces and the skies in finite and there was these incandescent V Vapors that form the first Suns of light the\n06:53 - quers which one quaser is a star so big as your whole universe as your whole galaxy and even bigger and so in permutation combination the ripple effect of the Divine mother took place\n07:07 - as she went Rippling across the Waters of space with the still awareness the center of the the storm of creation the Shiva remains still and because of the\n07:20 - presence his Stillness the Divine sh the energy became Dynamic the Stillness did nothing but in his doing\n07:34 - nothing creation was created when God did nothing creation were created if you Angry God and he does something can you imagine what happened he's doing nothing because God\n07:49 - is I'm really talking about God not your Our Father which are in heaven I'm really talking about the God of all gods and the Lord of all Lords who has no name\n08:01 - who art thou I Know Thee not and yet I know and yet I am Of Thee I cannot comprehend thee Lord th emperor of divinity so what do I do is beyond my\n08:16 - thought and reason I sit I sit and melt in Silence of thy love oh infinite make me thy truth make me thy love eternal Lord of [Music]\n08:43 - Light",

the 12 signs of the zodiac the 28 nakshatras on it and from there the king of kings java not sanat-kumara was an aspect of shiva goraksha babaji he rules this world from trade deep in\n00:45 - sambal food which is now known as Shambhala it is mispronounced as Shambhala you are of Shambala already Shambhala and was sort of somber so sambal pool yes\n01:03 - so sambal pour is the place where the Kalki will be but there is another sample pool between the aurora borealis of the Northern Lights and the Gobi Desert this sambal pour is also known as\n01:14 - shred deep the white island which is a natural place so all these things are going to happen but we must not focus on the physical and perishable body and mind we must make the but first we must\n01:29 - get clear in our minds who are we are we the divine imperishable soul or are we the diseased body are we this house of flesh and bone which sleeps the case and dies or are we the immortal\n01:43 - consciousness king of the earth in skies we are not a body and have a soul we are a soul and have a body which is perishable garment so if we leave so much investment in on the physical body\n01:56 - which must ultimately be consigned to the flames so which ideal utopia which egalitarian society are you talking about a society which will burn itself in the flames and\n02:09 - the ashes after a period of eight years why are you talking about the immortal souls that you are which will live on from life to life and from eternity to eternity let's simplify our language\n02:20 - let's get to the point directly we are a soul and have a body we are not a body and have a soul and if we are a soul we are immortal and so the realization this immortality even without chariots\n02:33 - even without levitation we will be levitating it will be as common as your natural breathing this will come in about insatiable the end mass transition from the ignorance of body an\n02:47 - association of mind to knowing that I am Atma Brahma Umbra must me that I am this divine soul and not the de cable body I am spirit I'm truth I'm love divine this body mind the dream of mine close your\n03:07 - eyes and say after me I'm spirit I'm truth I'm love divine this body is but a dream of mine I'm spirit I'm truth I'm love divine this body mind a dream of mine\n03:27 - I'm spirit I'm truth I'm love divine this body mind a dream of mine have you got the key essence of what we've come to learn here and what I've come to teach if you feel that I have\n03:44 - simplified this question a great deal I able to understand didn't know so the markaba is no big deal Vikramaditya is written on the Markab ah by the throne which was given by Indra\n03:54 - to him and he had the 28th officer Oz on him and Raja Bhoj came to sit on the Merkava and he was not allowed to sit on the market because he was not a worthy King not as worthy as Vikramaditya cuz\n04:05 - I'm talking about 57 BC and then go to me Putra shalivahana succeeded Vikramaditya but then beyond the king vikramaditya beyond Vikramaditya our King Arthur is\n04:19 - Vikram Aditya there's another which is King George the celestial Christ but beyond King George there is another one who is the Christos the celestial Michael who is son of Kumar the slayer\n04:35 - of the dragon okay I've written Sarkis or dark Ajit slayer of the great death the great dragon Yasuo called our Castle so therefore this is very important to understand that we are a spirit and\n04:54 - definitely they will come a mass enlightenment yes this will be in the sub T oke we're all Minds will be enlightened nothing new has been set by our window nothing\n05:05 - new is being set by the New Age books we're all saying hickory dickory dock.the mouse ran up the clock the clock struck one the mouse ran down hickory dickory dock that's my answer to\n05:16 - all complicated fish I'm a simple guy uneducated from the village of sambal poor there stay with my lord the Kalki yes yes the questions have been answered Satya is the age in this attitude now\n05:35 - like now we are not in the Satya we are now personally this group is in Satya in the - octave wherever there is a master at whichever place talking to disciples talking to\n05:48 - devoted listeners and lovers of God that place changes its aura its radiance from far-off even the nature spirits can see our light from the woods yonder they are think some of them are already around us\n06:00 - they have been curious to know that what the Son of Man is doing we all the son of man we are divine inherently and to claim our birthright the fastest way the Lightning path is Kriya yoga and yes\n06:14 - levitation can be done if you open your heart and mind you will see me levitating in your rooms in the night tomorrow night when I call you up and then I enter your dreams you will see me\n06:25 - as per your mind which will allow it your mind has to be casted it out of your head the heart open and sleep very relaxed you've got nothing to do I have to do all the work from the cosmic\n06:40 - surgery the chakra surgery to cosmetic surgery of your chakra I will be doing so you don't have to worry you just have to relax and I will come and do the needful once I do it you'll be ready\n06:55 -

          "transcript": "00:00 - oh the only purpose of man sergeant on this earth is to seek God okay that is the first but before that I want to ask you one question which can be finished in a moment when I told you when you\n00:18 - individually asked me and call upon me I'll give you a one-on-one how many got the experience that raise your hands when you called me one-on-one okay naturally those who didn't call me with\n00:30 - sincerity didn't get an experience so that answers itself okay now we get to go to the Omkar why are you doing this because in this schooling we are talking about other than your physical body your\n00:46 - emotional body your mental body intuition what happens so when I turn to them how did the quality of your breath change anybody won't say anything about that yes okay yes so it's did you feel\n01:21 - anything in the breath did you taste anything did you see anything extrasensory perceptions in the breath we talked about what did you see in the breath what did you taste what did you\n01:30 - touch what did you feel okay you felt the slowing okay next yes [Music] so was the light day before it came when I told when I said when when you asked\n01:53 - me that happened is it only after you asked me what happened I'm talking when you individually called me secretly mentally do not help me with my breath that's the time what happened that's\n02:02 - what I'm talking about have you understood okay yes so your breath is not moving it was in the third eye you didn't move your breath you're not breathing so you're not focused on\n02:30 - the breath but you're focused on the third eye being focused on the breath the light came automatically of the corona as the breath move right you focused on the breath but the night came\n02:39 - in the third eye so what was easy he was just here he should move with you in the breath prove myself yes yes I'll tell you one thing it's very simple to work through 183 trillion\n03:48 - acetylene Nadi's because if you have no ego and you have no mind it can be done and and the consciousness the solitary singularity is everywhere and nowhere at the same time so for it numbers don't\n04:04 - matter at all why they don't matter because it is spirit and matter is matter matter is very small very small spirit is all-pervading so that's very good subtler the speed you see Kriya\n04:24 - within a Kriya yes [Music] [Music] fight the good fight with all your might for God is your strength\n05:06 - and God your light and the Satguru is a servant as your servant of humanity personifies your strength and your light I'm here to give you serve you for strength and light every time I thought\n05:42 - about it my lungs bellow it very gently was like deep deep earth it was just as gentle you know in and out okay so this is what happened at San Francisco what happened now today good\n06:09 - so you have now we are talking about the ohm as I chanted the ohm the quality of the the daya dimension changed anybody has any more to say yes I I became the yes yes of course that is\n06:37 - very good so when you became the breath did the youth transformed into the breath which is a very good way of meditation the quality of the bread did it lengthen no it all it must have\n06:48 - lengthened every time yes we are asking is feeble if you ask and I do it and hold hold on to that then it's good if you hold on to that it's good by keeping the degree of concentration of your\n07:25 - asking when you are asking with a certain certain intensity of emotion Gurunath please help me guru not please help me so the same concentration must be kept and he will he will be there\n07:40 - because he meets you at that that resonant frequency he meets you at that frequency if you lower it from your side then the breath will go back to normal\n07:49 - keep him at the frequency you asked him it's all science yes the so I want a clarification the spine is straight and the bow is bent so and the colors I believe are going up and\n08:10 - down the spine seven colors but how is it the bow yes the feeling of the seven colored light the seeing of it yes and I chanted ohm three or four times did the intensity of the colors or the length of\n08:39 - the breath did they change each time or did they remain constant I did it seven times because still the mind was scattered people's mind so to bring them to attention I die repeat it it again\n08:58 - and again calling calling all the faithful to practice Kriya I had to do it I had to do it four or five times calling the faithful to prayer yes it was a challenging with my body a lot\n09:23 - of pain but I so yeah you experience that now you have to keep going why I started you with the side meditation first is to collect the scattered mind and now since we are established in the\n09:47 - spirit of the divine and focus to the Satguru now we can have question answers right now if anybody wants to ask anything when you call me I will be there for this we have to give you\n10:36 - examples of people who have called me already and come here who were not well and they called me and they got well to a temperature who called me and the temperature became normal\n10:47 - instantaneously like today all the aches and pains have gone away I my necks and pains and tiredness have gone away right okay it's I I'm just I know that this happens but I make you raise your hands\n11:03 - so the others who have lesser faith than you they can do they can develop their faith by being in a in a in a congregation like this where we all have faith in ourselves in our teachers if\n11:20 - you have more faith in me I can help you more if you don't have faith in me you tie my hands you know I cannot go great gate-crashing into the personal property of your your mind\n11:35 - so you have to understand that whenever you call me I will be I will come whenever you call me I will come this is definite right you",

people [Applause] but our innermost intentions to merge the chiva with Shiva to merge your soul with the Supreme spirit\n00:45 - that is your long time goal that is your your lifelong aspiration is Lord let me die healthy and when I exit I have no fear of exit but I should be in a state of joy and peace when I Transit from my\n01:02 - physical body to my astral body and when I Transit from my Astrid to my spiritual body let it be a smooth Transit therefore I keep myself healthy and Body Mind and Spirit I\n01:21 - foreign of your grosser bodies gets more and more refined the Consciousness expands tension of a bubblegum have you ever had\n01:47 - a bubble gum what do you call it a numerical bubble gum you blow it like this I&#39;ve seen these little girls with it and sometimes comes on their face when they blow the bubble gum when they\n01:58 - blow the bubble gum if you see the outer walls they become thinner and thinner as the bubble becomes because more and more transmission transparent so your\n02:08 - evolution is like the bubble gum you&#39;re expanding from within till that bubblegum becomes so refined that you cannot see its publicly transparent and you feel that you have\n02:19 - attained much that is that is the great state where you see yourself in the birds and the bees the flowers and the trees and\n02:31 - the water and the Rushing River I bring you to such beautiful places to expand your Consciousness that&#39;s why I said decided 30 years ago with all my Retreats would be more of a celebration\n02:42 - and less of a meditation because you meditate when you have to achieve a goal you celebrate when you&#39;ve achieved the goal so why not be positive from the very beginning\n02:53 - why not celebrate from the very beginning so life is a celebration [Applause] hold your head high hold your soul High\n03:04 -

Breathe Me breathe you&#39;re in the glass breathe [Applause] we transform and therefore you is the presence\n05:06 - everything is around you is nature your nature this part of the spirit is within your quotes of nature within your wrappings you still point of Eternity is within\n05:24 - the innermost part of your being who are you what is your identity you are the skill point of Eternity the Eternal Spa of the inevitable being called Shiva which is within you is without\n05:43 - [Applause] [Applause] inhale love foreign [Applause]\n06:16 - [Music] [Applause] [Music] hold up and exhale love for Earth peace a real\n06:53 - love for selfies [Music] and let it mix with every atom of your being that is the Love Light Of Love push its way into every and we only in\n07:04 - your lungs and every molecule in your body is saturated with love and then close your eyes and radiate love for Earth peace like the sun radiates this way it is\n07:27 - a new meditation has been formed but please Society it&#39;s a simple meditation does anyone find this complex it is as simple as good now raise your hands who like this\n07:45 -

within the Christmas present that you are you have the Krishna Consciousness for Christ&#39;s consciousness that&#39;s what we are doing our clear you to unwrap\n10:16 - just happens the beautiful wrapping paper which is around us so once we unwrap it the wrapping paper is very fancy and\n10:30 -

yoga teaching and had expressed a desire to see me a yogi from India hail salassi Thrice great from the house of Jaa was also called the Conquering Lion of Judah the same title\n01:06 - held by King David in the Bible salasi was 225th in descent from the line of King [Music] Solomon soon we were driving along in my\n01:18 - disciples Austin Cambridge our guides who had established contacts with the house of Ethiopia were very happy to be party to this great meeting\n01:30 - I was told to keep this meeting a secret because his majesty was a guest of the royal family of England and for all practical purposes to the African and Rastafarian religious communities he was\n01:43 - thought to have left his bodily aboard in 1975 however this was untrue as I recall meeting with him 7 years later in 1982 our guides took us to the residence\n01:59 - on great Portland Street he stopped the car and entered a mansion-like home there were two robust and Ruddy men all smiles sitting at the\n02:11 - reception Scotland Yard detectives I presumed my guess was right as they simply told us who they were when we introduced ourselves he was obviously given the\n02:26 - highest security of the land since the King was a guest of the now late Queen Mary the gentleman led us up a broad red carpeted Stairway to a simple but Tastefully decorated parlor with soft\n02:41 - green furniture and carpet The Green Room of the palace I said to myself I was used to all this green and pink rooms which were there at our own\n02:53 - house in India the butler came and asked us if he would like something to drink but we declined we waited for hail salasi the king about whom my grandfather had told\n03:08 - me many stories it is said that ha salasi was a visiting board member of the League of Nations this was the international organization before the United Nations\n03:20 - had formed during an international meeting a misant drew a pistol to shoot the king he did not move but steadily looked the murderer directly in the\n03:32 - eyes consequently the man dropped his pistol and was led Away by the security Gods after about a 20 minute wait his majesty the king entered we all stood up and bowed he responded to our bows and B\n03:49 - us sit down he was accompanied by his grandson a very impressive person 7 ft tall and about 25 years of age he was introduced to us as Prince Jakob pronounced\n04:06 - Jakob as in Hebrew he had completed his military studies in the National Defense Academy in Pune my hometown in India when pleasantries had been exchanged Cakes and Pastries\n04:22 - eaten his majesty arose and so did we all according to the Royal protocol he went into into his inner chamber and requested me to follow as we sat opposite one another I\n04:37 - had the opportunity to have a deeper look at him he was about 90 years of age his eyes were a glowe with the experience of Life his stoic head was held steady on\n04:50 - his sturdy shoulders his hair was Curly and white as snow when I peered into his heart I saw his truly Majestic and life and\n05:01 - soul oh what a sight what a man truly great men do not have to show what they are they are what they are I thought I was 38 years of age then he asked me if I could perform a\n05:19 - Haven a fire ceremony for him and his family I consented to do so but told him of the smoke which may cause a fire alarm to go off he made all the arrangements and also\n05:34 - informed the Scotland Yard security guards and so we got underway preparing for the sacred fire ceremony I told the king that in ancient times around 7,000\n05:48 - BC a great king from India called mahandata had performed a stupendous Haven in the Congo Basin in Africa this was mentioned mentioned in the purans of\n06:02 - course it's a metaphorical saying that the sand in many parts of the Congo resembles holy Ash however it is interesting to note that it does\n06:14 - appear that that sand is the remnant of an ancient fire ceremony performed by the king mahandata he showed a great interest in ancient history and told me that there\n06:29 - was a prayed via the Silk Road between Ethiopia and India before Cleopatra's time it was during the time of the Queen Sheba of Ethiopia that Africa learned a lot of the spiritual law and spiritual\n06:44 - techniques from India This was later passed on from Ethiopia to the Egyptians I was deeply intrigued to hear this from the king who himself was a\n06:55 - deeply spiritual and divine soul in India call such a soul a Mahatma or a great Soul like Mahatma Gandhi such Souls visit our Earth rarely many interesting things I learned\n07:14 - that day from this great king Sage who reminded me of the Ancient King janak of the ramayan I told him that beim the Pand Prince and cousin of Lord Krishna had\n07:28 - married a girl called Hada from Ethiopia as we talked all the preparations for the fire ceremonies were made the clarified butter the rice\n07:41 - Etc I then proceeded to perform the Haven for the welfare of humanity and for Spiritual progress to all the sacred flames of the fire ceremony danced to the chanting of\n07:54 - mantras all those present were engulfed in the Holy Ambience as we rejoiced in the spirit of the Lord after the sacred ceremony was over his majesty was very touched he and the\n08:08 - queen then showed me what they needed to show me as I passed through their bed chamber I looked at him and his Majestic bed I thought it to be made of platinum or white gold but did not ask him the\n08:24 - Royal bed was so huge with its curtains that I mistook it for another smaller chamber upon his showing an interest in the science of yog I gave to him the yogic\n08:39 - HSA breathing technique which he practiced successfully 6 months later he telephoned me in India and told me of the spiritual well-being and sound sleep\n08:52 - he was able to have after practicing the technique [Music] CP [Music]\n09:23 - [Music] n sh l",

          "title": "The Story of Rama",
          "transcript": "00:02 - the only purpose of man's San on this Earth is to seek God in India we have two naat one is the dura Puja NRI and one is\n00:17 - Ram coming back from vanas NRI so is this is the ram coming back from vanas NRI right so now one of ram weing one of RAM so the Lord Ram he was a great solar\n00:34 - initiate and a Divine being incarnate on our Earth 7,000 years ago according to the yoga cycle or 70,000 years ago I don't want to get into\n00:45 - this when he came to be a witness to the karma of man he descended into the nether regions and bro where death happens that is the earth he was shown of his beams and\n00:59 - known as vikrant vant means the Lord who is Sha of his Aura and Splendor he was Shan of his the son he was a solar God Rah he was Sha of his beams the sun was Sha of his beams\n01:12 - the sun Christ came but had no Radiance as he walked amongst men and suffered amongst us and then after after passing through all the tribulations and trials of this\n01:24 - life he suffered like a mortal being and knew their pains and knew their Joys and Sorrows he was a tear tears of their tears and the laugh of their laughter when he was so much one with them he had\n01:34 - experienced what man wanted and then he ascended again to heaven and then he was reinstated but while he was on Earth they put a bramble of thorns around his neck he was now this is about TW what 5\n01:50 - 10,000 years before Christ so the concept of the Bramble of thorns around the head of ram the sun was Sha of its beams and instead of its place the son incarnate was Lord Rama and he had a\n02:05 - bramble of thorns on his head as he became Karma saki witness to the karma of man and then he ascended after suffering for Humanity taking on their karma and all the mental\n02:20 - BOS he ascended to Heaven Again the the Bramble of thorns was taken from him and again he became full of radiant splendor and was given the beams of his Radiance and Glory back again reinstated in the\n02:35 - coronation today is the day where he gets reinstated into his glory and Splendor and he is known as gaban say after me gaban gab that means the Lord of irradiant\n02:50 - Splendor this is the story of Rah in the yogic philosophical and occult sense in the normal sense people celebrate his coming he had gone for 14 years to vanas because his father the king Dash\n03:08 - had three wives Calia Kia was the eldest whose son was Ram the second was sumitra whose son was\n03:26 - shatran and the third was K whose son was bat and K wanted her son to ascend the throne so once in battle with Dash she had put her hands in the spokes of the\n03:45 - wheel and made prevented Dash from falling where he could he could sort of aim his final arrow and kill the king of the other side it was because of her help she was a great warrior and a brave\n03:57 - lady so he said okay ask me any ask for me anything and I will give it to you she said not now oh Lord I shall ask you when the right time comes\n04:08 - so when the time came for Ram's coronation she went to Dhat and said I do not want RAM on the throne you have promised me a boon and I want my son bat to become the king of\n04:21 - aoda so this was a Karma and then Ram tells bat it's nobody's faults it's nobody's fault I pulling the Veil of Maya have to play this drama I know I have to do it you do\n04:34 - your work I will do my prab it is my prab which I have taken by my own yog Maya so then Rah went for 14 years to vanas and today is the day after 14 years he\n04:48 - returns his brother bhat ruled for 14 years aoda but this the Indian emotion and sentiment he kept Ram's shoes his sandals on the throne\n05:00 - and he woried it he he ruled as Regent the King was still Ram so his silver sandals were on the throne of aoda this is how much he loved him how much he revered and adored him with so much\n05:15 - reverence and when Rah came back he reinstated him on the throne not once did he Ascend on the throne so this is this is known as the noble one the ARA that's where the word AR comes from the\n05:31 - noble one that's why we call our sons Arya the noble ones my grandson's name is Arya so it's a great honor even in Persia they have this name meaning the\n05:44 - same so today Ram comes back from uh thing and is restored in all his Splendor and Glory the Earthly story of it I told you the philosophic story because today is the sah I thought we\n05:58 - should celebrate with the story and a little song of devotion which I'll sing and I'll explain to you a little K which I will give you now uh about ra [Music]\n06:56 - so it says this is how Kiran is done who who all have heard of K you've heard of K now listen to how Kiran is done in a small way you've never heard Kiran before Kiran is like this and so the\n07:12 - devotees SAT before R and he says he says I do not know how to pray oh Lord neither do I know how to meditate oh Lord RAM have compassion on me I'm th\n07:34 - child no meditation I know do not know where your feet are I cannot see them and I do not know how to love you I am simple I have not learned these ways\n07:57 - of yoga and these sophisticated techniques so so it says I don't even know how you look this is just a statue but I love you I don't know what you look like you\n08:26 - know but I love you whether I meet you or not whether I meet you or not oh Lord so he was doing the K yog because of purity of heart he had learned the\n08:53 - technique there was no one to teach him he says your breath is rooted in your name is rooted in my breath PR means oh Lord I don't care because your breath is rooted\n09:11 - your name is rooted in my [Music] breath you are the correct one to be served and I am your servant you are the one to be sung to\n09:41 - and I am the singer so you are the one who the job is to be done to and I am the Jer I am the one who's doing the job you are the one who's the job to be done to it's a\n09:55 - perfect harmony now I've got it all I figured it out so it says that you are the person to be prayed to I am the person praying to you you are the prayed\n10:16 - to and means being near and because of this I absorbed with you I'm one with you so this is the thing the the prayer which in marati which is my dialect we\n10:36 - chant to Lord Ram there's a picture of Lord ra oh J",

          "title": "A Message From India to People All The World Over",
          "transcript": "00:04 - Prayer. I bow to the indwelling spirit residing in\nall of us. May His Grace be upon all sincere truth seekers. Today we are gathered here for the single\npurpose of seeking the Supreme Reality which is the perennial source of happiness.\n01:15 - The Supreme Reality has one of its essential\nqualities called happiness. And in our day to day lives, in all the little\nactivities we have and in the rough and tumble of life, we are constantly seeking for that\none Truth called happiness. Whether we know it or not. If you're working in a job and you get a promotion,\nthe ultimate effect of the promotion is happiness.\n01:58 - If you have a married life and you are in\nharmony with your partner, the result is happiness. If you're a young sportsman, and you go in\nfor an Olympic gold medal or win some sports activities, the ultimate result is bliss,\njoy, happiness. But all these happiness' are temporary and\nevanescent. God Himself is happiness.\n02:35 - Bliss, which we call SatChidAnanda, Bliss. And He is camouflaged between every success\nand every fulfillment of your desire. It is the Lord, the Supreme Reality, that\nis camouflaged between between every little success, every little harmony, every little\ndesire that is fulfilled, according to your needs.\n03:04 - There is a happiness. And this happiness, is God smiling through\nyour success, your harmony, your fulfillment of desires. But He smiles and goes away. So now, people ask, the people who are thinking\ndeeply,what is that happiness by having which\n03:34 - all happiness' shall be satisfied. From my happiness, to owning a ferrari, having\na ten billion dollar bank balance plus having a beautiful husband and wife, free from all\nthe cares and worries of this world. Now that's a tall order. No single person, place or thing can fulfill\nsuch a demand.\n04:16 - That I want to be happy under all circumstances\nat all times. Even if you have a billion dollars and your\nmind is a mess and you're suffering in agony, what's the use of billion dollars. Or if you have the best facility or the best\nlife partner but you're always in agitation about where you should keep your billion dollars,\nstill your mind is in agony, there's no use\n04:40 - without happiness life has very little meaning\nbecause it doesn't consummate the desire. You want a Ferrari, you get it, your desire\nis consummated. It's fulfilled. So this simple word happiness, is with the\nSupreme Reality. The Supreme Reality remains pure, immovable,\nunchangeable, in spite of the changing scenario\n05:12 - of the world. The world is a passing show, many colors,\nmany vicissitudes, many emotions, many successes many failures. And therefore, I have come today to give you\nthis message. Again I have come to give you a taste of this\nperennial happiness.\n05:38 - For dear souls, let me tell you that today's\nsatsang, today's gathering is experiential. I want you to experience the God Essence. But that too will not be with you permanent. I will give you the bliss temporarily, I will\nactivate the spiritual mechanism in you, the spiritual kundalini, the chakras.\n06:09 - I will activate them now. And at the retreat, one month later, I shall\nawaken this bliss. whereby and with the practice the simple science\nof Kriya Yoga. The simple science, anybody can do it, and\neverybody can do it. It's simple science of breathing with awareness.\n06:31 - And by the constant application, of breathing\nwith awareness, you can bring peace and joy to your day to day living. It's not outer pleasures, or desires or things\nwhich can make you happy. It's your inner state of Bliss which makes\nyour life a quality life. So as to improve the quality of your life\nnot the quantity.\n07:11 - We want quality living, we want to be in harmony\nwith our partner, our family, our brothers and sisters, mothers and daughters. We want to live in peace and harmony and we\nwant to give them joy and receive joy from them also. So this is the main sub-strata of all we are\nsearching for.\n07:35 - Some thinks its money but if money comes and\nand you get it, and it starts burning your hands, you'll drop the cash. Some thinks its a beautiful partner but if\nthe partner is bugging you and chewing your brains day and night, then there's no use\nof the beautiful partner. Beauty goes down the drain.\n07:57 - There must be a happiness behind it. The ultimate result, the ultimate result,\nof all human craving is total satisfaction in whatever he does. Total complete satisfaction with the person\nhe meets, with the place wherein he dwells and the thing or the things that he possesses.\n08:22 - If there is not complete satisfaction, then\nthose things have no meaning. And to bring about such satisfaction, the\nyogis have asked themselves the question, for thousands of years, India has been a beacon\nof light and love to the world, spreading very slowly. Because it is not a pathway of conversion\nor forcing others, it is a pathway which comes\n08:56 - like the morning dew very silent but it's\npresented before you every morning. You have to have the eyes to see, the heart\nto feel and the ears to hear the silent dewdrops falling on the leaves. The silent condensation taking place. And so here it is before you the message,\nsilently and humbly.\n09:20 - When you practice this, after the question\nwas asked what is that happiness by having which all happiness would be satisfied?

          "transcript": "00:03 - now hello everybody and God bless humanity is our uniting religion breath are uniting prayer and Consciousness are uniting\n00:17 - God let us today speak something about the breath and the mind if you take it from a very practical point of\n00:33 - view the mind when not trained but not disciplined is the only obstacle which comes between the\n00:48 - sear and the truth that he wants to see because an agitated mind and its thoughts are like the ripples of thoughts on a lake ripples on a lake are like the\n01:05 - ripples of thoughts in the mind's Lake in order to see the truth in order to see the moon of Truth in the skies we must quell our\n01:21 - thoughts and analogy as long as there are ripples of thought in the mind's Lake we cannot see the moon of our Delight that is our truth\n01:37 - within in order to see that we must calm and quell the ripples of thoughts in our minds L and the\n01:52 - yogis greatest contribution to the science of self-realization and the knowingness of God is making us aware that our\n02:08 - breath our thoughts and mind are intimately connected if you calm one the other slows down if you slow one the other calms down so if you calm your breath the\n02:24 - thoughts slow down if you calm your thoughts the breath slow goes down calms down and this is the principle of pranayam which later went to other countries like Japan\n02:43 - and China and all and were known as other techniques like taii Chi comes from the word chti life force energy Sanskrit word chi is a Sanskrit word meaning PR life force\n02:58 - energy PR chti chit chitt is the Mind stuff chiti is the life force energy the chi from which the word chi has come from chiti they just took Chi and left the\n03:12 - T and the third is chit which means Consciousness so Body Energy and Consciousness these are the three things respectively CH body chiti life force energy and ch with\n03:32 - Consciousness so we use the breath to calm the mind if there are two people and both their minds are full of thoughts going\n03:44 - chaaaa then they won't listen to one another but they'll be fighting with one another you know before listening to one another so both are going to try to put their arguments forward and they may be\n03:56 - saying the same thing but they will be arguing it happens many many times that's what I'm saying y then what would we argue about that's because we didn't hear one another y we saying the same\n04:07 - thing so we have to calm down calm the Mind observe one another and then one by one put your case forward what you have to say so for that to calm the mind there's a very simple uh you know pray\n04:24 - I'm going to do with you there's a very balancing Tai balancing the energy balancing the pr a am balancing the pr you know with a sensation of PR not only the pr or the life force energy is\n04:40 - balanced the breath is balanced and the mind is also balanced the ayam of pran the sensation of pran so everybody now in order to\n04:53 - qu the fidgety thoughts the mental chatter breathe with me inhale life old life and exhale life that is your breath\n05:31 - exhale death hold [Music] death inhale life hold\n05:55 - life exhale death hold death inhale life you can see the heaving that's when I inhale my\n06:21 - breath hold life don't yawn hold life I'm seeing many guys when they inhale the breath they take it with a yawn there no need to yawn it's not\n06:33 - necessary it's not a necessary part of pranayam yeah you can laugh if you want it doesn't matter it's an open session I can see people laughing but it's okay hold\n06:49 - life hold it as long as the Fresh Life Force and oxygen pushes its way through every alveoli in your lungs and refreshes it the thoughts are coming down now exhale\n07:08 - death hold death hold death at Bay but in your awareness inhale life hold\n07:30 - lungs are filled with the light of the Sun the vivifying glory of nature exhale out into nature hold death keep your breath out keep your breath\n07:54 - out inhale life as you breathe in hold life and let the exhilarating sun and its light stream into the alveoli of your lungs lungs are filled with fresh\n08:12 - life and light salubrious Health giving energy now breathe out and exhale death you die with every exhalation hold death\n08:30 - in your aura feel it it's a joy to be dead you must be aware of your inhaled life and exhale death and be something above it which is consciousness inhale life hold\n08:50 - life exhale death hold death inhale life hold life and\n09:12 - relax now you were with me I was breathing through you you were breathing through me Humanity are uniting religion breath are uniting prayer it is breath and not\n09:24 - any sermon or ritual or cult or Creed which will unite the world for the breath is the connectus connec eye of the whole of humanity this is my message to you no\n09:38 - prayers no Christmas cars no Puja no scho no namas nothing is required but breathing with awareness as you breathe with awareness you round off the rough edges of your\n09:54 - ignorance and then you see that all the prayers and rituals and the puas were done in order to achieve the self that lies at the core of your own\n10:10 - being so breathe dear Souls be a brarian breathe with love and breathe with light rejoice when life comes into you as breath as PR and rejoice when life goes out of you as death as\n10:26 - M Life comes into you as J and goes out of you as so say enjoy enjoy this this game of life but always be aware that you are floating in the aroma and the Bliss of\n10:43 - God and that his Essence and Aroma is also within you that which is within is without the answer lies within the answer lies without and to qu the interfering mind we need to use the\n10:56 - balsom of the breath modern people say that tea tree is cures everything use the tea tree of the breath to cure all the problems and the eczema so the Panacea for all problems is pranayam the\n11:11 - breath the most effective breath is done by the Kundalini Kaa yog which you can learn from any one of our aaras of the sidat yog parara and the support system is all\n11:29 - over the world World in United States in UK in Italy we're having one in France in Germany we have and in India of course in Australia so Children of the Earth We Are One humanity\n11:49 -

          "transcript": "00:05 - Oh [Music] onon demand jnana swaroopam Nevada roopam yoga Indra medium a varuga vapium sri but GU room\n00:27 - Netta Mumbai [Music] today you will be empowered and initiated into the sacred science of Kriya yoga called the Shiva Shakti on us\n00:59 - and on of the Kriya yoga pranayama and it is also called the prana pond Edna the sacred fire ceremony of the yogi where he offers the inhaled into the exhaled breath and he exhaled into\n01:16 - the inhaled breath by offering the sailed into the inhaled and vice versa the yogi the practicing yogini and yogi arrest the aging process of their body cells and they stopped mutation and\n01:35 - growth if this is done regularly without break then the effect shall take place but let me give you a fair idea many of you are new as you gradually begin with half an hour of practice you increase it\n01:53 - to one hour then to two hours try to make to us your own time with yourself and as the breath is lengthened it is purifying your whole system your lungs your heart are being rested because you\n02:16 - by willful pranayam are taking an extra oxygen and o3 from the atmosphere and since your body will be so fused with pure oxygen the heart will get time to rest the lungs will work less and\n02:33 - therefore the wear and tear of your body will be diminished this is the science scientific part of Kriya yoga the pumping of the heart will also be less so by the sincere practice\n02:48 - of Korea you a yogi can rest his body the functions of his heart lungs pulse everything is rested and he tends towards the process of the rejuvenation his body gets rejuvenated the science of\n03:09 - Kriya yoga is very simple and the crest jewel of the Kriya yoga the basic body which is the basic and also very important is the pranayama which is done which is called the spinal breathing\n03:27 - there are two currents in the human body one is the pranic current and one is the apana current in the pranic current the breath flows up the hollow of the spine when it flows up it is called the pranic\n03:45 - current it is soothing and evolutionary in nature it evolves your consciousness and rejuvenates your body cells the upward breath of pran rejuvenates your body cells the downward breath is called\n04:05 - the upon ik breath out of the five front so pran is the upward upon breath is the downward breath this breath burns all negativity in your body dissolves disease decay and death it dissolves it\n04:22 - burns all the negativity it burns it detoxifies the body so Kriya yoga the basic meaning of Kriya Yoga is that it is a rejuven detox technique the pranic current rejuvenates your body cells and\n04:41 - the upon ik current detoxifies your body cells so it's a rejuven detox technique now in America we have many detox techniques but what is the use of detoxing\n04:55 - what is the use of detoxing without rejuvenation so it's half the knowledge here we come with a message from the ancient Himalayas in India to give you a rejuven detox technique you've not had a\n05:10 - combination have you attended a rejuven detox you or many of you have retired but ended detox classes right detox sessions detox right how many of you have done the detox programs raise\n05:22 - your hands everybody raise your hands everybody yeah everybody's done but rejuven the rejuvenation you haven't done because the science is still in the Himalayan fastness and melting from the\n05:37 - snows and coming down the streams along which we flow we people float along to you across the seven seas and bring you the science of rejuvenation and kayakalpa kya calpis rejuvenating and\n05:54 - getting a new body so it is a rejuven detox technique the second thing which Kriya yoga the spinal breathing does is the downward breath burns your past evil karma and the upward breath evolves your\n06:14 - consciousness this is the spiritual aspect of it rejuven detox is for the physical body every physical body dies after 80 to 90 years and it's thrown away in the rubbish dust to dust so\n06:28 - spend some time in the rejuven detox techniques but not too much time spend more time on the immortal essence which is your soul so after you do the rejuvenate ox and keep your body in a\n06:42 - healthy condition after all it is a vehicle to God then go on to the more deeper spiritual one that to burn your negativity past evil karma with the upon ik breath and with the pranic breath you\n06:55 - evolve your consciousness so this is the second benefit of Kriya yoga and by this we will spread earth peace through self peace you will become so peaceful that your peaceful radiation will affect all\n07:13 - those around by example you will spread earth peace through self peace this is very very important the science of Kriya yoga that's what\n07:26 - it's called the science of Kriya yoga but nevertheless it's practice is rooted in love so we have love and we have science but before we I want to teach you the Kriya yoga I would like to tell\n07:43 - you that there are certain things which is the soul cry and the Creed of our organization which I'd like to tell you which everybody who is initiated they must know this Creed the soul cry is\n08:05 - this this is what we say if earth peace is to herald the dawn of the new age we must all realize and here's the soul cry humanity are uniting religion breath are uniting prayer and consciousness are\n08:29 - uniting God because this helps all denominations to bind together it contradicts no religion or creed but complements all because in this catholicity of this statement are\n08:51 - contained all the religions and all the ideologies and scriptures and yoga practices of the world because what do we say humanity is our uniting religion I think that's the biggest religion on\n09:05 -

teacher teaches the nothing from which the whole of creation is created I'll give you something which you can stomach a pill I won't make it\n00:39 - too heavy I'll give you a light dose if in a fraction of a second the whole Earth planet Earth was shrunk to the size of a marble and was put in a weighing scale\n00:55 - what do you call the weighing scale the scale scale what's the word for it balance the balance the the the weighing scale the balancing weighing\n01:10 - scale what would be the weight of the Earth can you imagine how much it would be it would fall to Eternity if and you little people in the earth what a crunch there would be\n01:25 - unimaginable splitting headache is not the word there's no there's no word so you would be nothing the Earth was shrunk in a moment to the size of a marble the density in finite\n01:38 - put in a wiing scale and on the other side you put one marble of nothingness a cubic cm of nothingness and you weigh the balance scale it will tip to the side of the nothingness the nothingness\n01:55 - will be heavier than the weight of the whole earth put together this is a scientific fact it is a known fact I'll explain this later how it is because if if the marble gets still\n02:15 - smaller and pushes itself out of existence its mass is infinite and the nothing is already reached that stage when I give you the transmission your mass is infinite and therefore you\n02:28 - cannot decay you cannot age anything traveling at the speed of light you travel at the speed of light in a rocket for thousands of years and go back you'll come back\n02:38 - ageless and your children will be 90 years old you'll still be the same age you you went at\n02:50 - now the color of the auras anybody want to say if you establish it the basic color is white and gold raise your hands you saw the white and gold Ora okay who who saw the cottony effect so\n03:03 - that's about 80% uh 90% who saw the cottony effect the cottony light yeah Smokey okay and uh who saw any other color besides that Violet\n03:18 - okay okay now when you go to Violet and all those are Kundalini colors in the besides the or the center core colors now this is just uh not to show\n03:30 - what colors I'm giving I'm just just to show you what you are I'm just an extension of yourself you are potentially Divine and you are the Buddha and you are the Christ you are\n03:40 - the dur and you are the Kali you are the Mary you are the Maya so take courage practice the techniques of the ham s\n03:55 - if you do want to know what the master of the true Guru is you must must have his experience if there is no experience then you are taking it from the teacher so sometime later in the Himalayas or in\n04:08 - puru or in the in the Alps or something you may meet your Guru will give you the experience they're not only limited but they set they concentrated in the Himalayas they're not limited to the\n04:18 - Himalayas they're all over the world but very few and far between only some of them who are not waking Dopey and sleepy are caught like this and they have to come here\n04:31 - so the Sleepy the dumb ones so we are the dumb gurus who've come here and uh in your charge so do with us what you will curse us or bless us it\n04:46 - makes no difference we'll keep burning like the incense stick and give you the flavor and Essence and it's all good and fun for us and God bless you all and may this family of love and strength and\n04:58 - courage grow and blast the bomb of Love blast out all negativity all hatred all fear on this Earth but my basic thing is that you must be Fearless before you you step upon this path be\n05:15 - happy I I broke my leg and I twisted it into it it split from here and it came this way and my head splintered I got a bullet to the side which grazed me and when I went to the hospital I did\n05:30 - nothing but meditate and sing and I used to roll off and give the hospital maximum trouble trying to get active before my time but I was not destined it took this it took its 3 months or\n05:39 - whatever it is it was to cure but I due to your grace and the grace of the Divine and His blessings I was never ever remember myself in a state of depression or getting low\n05:52 - anytime this is what I want to transfer to you permanently in your checking account this is my wealth I want to give to you I know it's very subtle and bizarre to\n06:03 - put in your checking account my peace of mind and my soul of heart but I can do this because you have experience that I can give you an experience I can also put my money in your checking\n06:19 - account the money the dollar of divine Consciousness the DDC in your CCA they every over here they speak everything in short you know they like\n06:34 - to shorten everything see so that's it and I and folks that's all that I have to give you for today I can see you sometime I'm just a buddy of\n06:47 - yours walking hand in hand I'm a buddy you know I'm a buddy that's what I am in India they call it the guru or sguru in America they call it the Buddy it's the same thing what's in the word\n07:03 - it's the experience that counts it's the experience that counts what's in a word what's in a dress it's the experience that counts how can I tell you in so many words that you are lagging behind\n07:15 - time take the Divine technique I'm not saying I'm the only one giving it in the Himalayan the Masters giving it I don't know anyone else here who's giving this sort of a technique with experience once\n07:25 -

          "transcript": "00:04 - my Danish word an Aussie Kaneda yeah so good or not if if someone is currently practicing Kriya yoga and they go to a fortune-teller will the fortune take into consideration the fact\n00:27 - that they're doing career he will definitely taken the fact that you are doing career I have been to I like to go to fortune tellers and you know astrologers at the Gannet are Sri\n00:45 - Yukteswar himself new cosmic astrology and he said don't be totally a slave to it don't depend on it totally but use it as a guideline so when I went the first time they told me that I was practicing\n01:01 - Kriya yoga they addressed me in a particular way when I went to the fortune-teller the nadi jo 'this the next time they told me I was practicing more and addressed me in a more\n01:11 - respectful way names change titles change so there's a constant updating if you practice meditation and yoke there's a constant updating of your spiritual progress there's a constant updating in\n01:27 - the nadi reading of your circumstances and it is said yes like I've said in my form your individual present explains your individual past - each one is allotted as exact and proper task - the\n01:42 - truth is truth we got the liar gets his only so do such deeds do such actions whose reactions you don't moon so it's very very important to thoughtfully practice with those activities those\n02:01 - thoughts which bring about good and joyous results if you think of negative thoughts if you think you're depressed I'm a poor contrary creature and I'm suffering all the while and I'm already\n02:14 - read and my back's painting my next painting my head spinning if you go to all these things then that collective thought if you dwell on a thought of disease\n02:24 - disease shall be the outcome if you dwell on the thought of light and love light and love shall be the outcome as yogev Tov lahiri mahasaya and Gotham Buddha both said you are what you think\n02:39 - which now the the Western world is is taking up and they are mayor making little notes and little booklets on things and thoughts which are true but people are still demonstrating it in\n02:54 - India what is Shakti path it's a very subtle flow of thought energy subtle flow of energy which heals other people so if your mind is perfected you are able to release your prana and heal\n03:09 - others but you do not do any healing practices I do not encourage it at all I do not do not encourage millionaires to donate a million in healing I tell them unless you are a billionaire\n03:20 - don't donate a million otherwise you'll be bankrupt if you have 20 million and you donate 1 million you can't break even in the in the cycle of spiritual progress only if you're a\n03:34 - billionaire and you donate a million then the cycle they the spiritual economic cycle can work unhindered so to do heal you must be a billionaire to give a million not a millionaire to give\n03:46 - a million you understand what I'm saying so 6 hours of meditation practice half an hour of healing fine three hours of meditation practice and one are revealing bad I know I'm cutting it high\n03:60 - and sharp because I want to discourage you from frittering away the energies of your mind do not fritter away the energies of your mind focus them and preserve them and\n04:12 - use the precious energy and vibrations of your mind to penetrate and pierce them through your lotus shrines to get to such a dawn and the divine indweller that's what it is meant to be applied to\n04:25 - energies are not meant to for self sympathy or crying over spilt milk this has happened that's happened let bygones be bygones focus the energies of your mind\n04:37 - on God you may ask me how can we do this is very difficult who knows we cannot do this how can we 24 us think of God we would love to but we can't why because of the habit of past sound\n04:53 - scars because of the habit of your past you cannot constantly think of God by but by repeated effort ripp repeated willpower if you say ohm ring wrong rupture of cavora chrome ring wrong\n05:15 - Raksha Raksha Raksha home ring wrong Raksha Raksha go rupture day in and day out then every morning when you get up the month will automatically start in your subconscious mind in spite of you\n05:29 - not wanting to do it now that is a true training of your subconscious mind training it to do what you want it to do training your conscious mind to do what you want to do so repetitive practice\n05:46 - and perseverance in yoga or mantras is the secret of success the West never understood this and this to say we do not know we went to India many people came to India tourists and all from\n06:00 - other countries from Western countries and they say the Indian people do a strange thing it's called muttering they mutter and what is this muttering all about and they keep buttering for hours\n06:13 - together and they found that muttering now America is very educated and they call it the mantra' they call it mantra a mantra is called mantra and they say that mantra can reduce your karma they\n06:32 - have learnt this and they themselves now have the mallas not that they were not willing to learn they were willing to learn but the time was not right the time has now ripe so people come and\n06:43 - they learn their mantra and they mitigate the negative karma because when you go to an astrologer on an RD the important thing that they tell you is this that they say practice the\n06:54 - mantra for the moon because the moon is debilitated or Prak practice the mantra for Jupiter or Mars and then they give a mantra or the Guru gives you the mantra he is the one who has the authority if\n07:06 - he gives you the mantras of Jupiter or mercury and your mercury or your Mars is in a malefic aspect to your activities then that benefit aspect of your activities is mitigated by the practice\n07:25 - of the mantra now Kriya yoga is such a beautiful process that when you breathe God through your spine when you concentrate on God and breathe through your spine that is the time the negative\n07:40 - vibrations the DNA in your spine are dissolved of their negative vibrations so therefore the practice of Kriya yoga is most effective and it is called the Lightning path how do we determine and\n07:56 - how do we know that we are practicing Kriol correctly one of the great hallmarks of the original Kriya yoga that it is practiced with concentration breathing in your sushumna spinal canal\n08:17 - so sushumna breathing is Kriya yoga when you practice the concentrated breath called the practice of lifeforce energy in the central channel of the spine you are practicing Kriya yoga",

nothing this is the human explanation and I&#39;m sure that you will be happy with this but I go further I say even if there is nothing\n01:27 - God God can make creation out of nothing that&#39;s why God is God and we are we he can do the impossible do the illogical do the unreasonable do that which is beyond\n01:43 - human comprehension otherwise what&#39;s the difference between God in man that&#39;s why God is God because he goes beyond human comprehension even the highest imagination even the highest\n01:57 - genius even the highest intuition even the highest God cannot comprehend what the Lord God can do can we humble\n02:09 - ourselves at this juncture right doesn&#39;t make sense it doesn&#39;t make logic how can you out of nothing create something but God does\n02:24 - not create something out of nothing he creates everything out of nothing so then the Catch 22 comes either call everything\n02:37 - nothing or call everything something everything everything call it either everything or call it nothing but my further logic to this is we have to we human beings have\n02:55 - the table and the chair and our bodies and this thing so we have to be practical pragmatic and call it sub the creation is something it&#39;s matter it&#39;s iron it&#39;s silicon it&#39;s flesh blood\n03:07 - and bones and teeth and calcium we have to call it something right but don&#39;t tell God what you should call\n03:22 - whatever out of the nothing is everything created out of the nothing is everything created I&#39;m going to stop\n03:36 - here till you settle down so the the young gentleman has asked the question uh what&#39;s your name Banu bhanu bhanu has asked the question how\n03:53 - can something be created out of nothing I believe I made this statement somewhere in one of my talks I remember that when I was list your audio the AUD book out of the nothing is the\n04:10 - everything created right right so I&#39;m going to repeat what the answer out of the nothing the everything is created the first answer is at the human\n04:22 - level the human tining mind of say the Newton or the Einstein or the jaish Chandra BOS the great scientist or even the secondary Gods even the secondary Gods like the god of\n04:37 - wind fire water Neptune Ze Zeus Agni vun even the secondary Gods the answer would be that out of the nothing everything is created this has been said because that\n04:56 - nothing is not comprehensible by man he has not been to it none of his scientific equipments nor his five senses nor his sixth sense nor his seventh sense has been able to grasp\n05:08 - that State of Consciousness the state of divine mind is a homogeneous state it is the fabric of universal homogeneous light it&#39;s one it&#39;s plain and when at the beginning of\n05:23 - time the homogeneous light gets a ripple of the Divine thought by permutation combination it makes creation light creates sound sound creates form form intensifies by\n05:38 - permutation combination from the subatomic gunas astral gas to the sub of atomic electron protons and neutrons which make the atom which make the molecules which make the living cell and\n05:52 - therefore make life so nothing here could mean that it is so subtle that it&#39;s not comprehensible by man and the secondary gods therefore we call it nothing but it has to be something is\n06:03 - made out of something nothing cannot be created out of nothing or something cannot be created out of nothing I go a step further now I given the first argument it&#39;s satisfactory\n06:17 - that it&#39;s so subtle beyond the human senses beyond the five senses that and the instruments that we cannot grasp that frequency of isness God is the isness\n06:30 - God is the isness of the zero not zero God is the isness of the being not being yet he is above being and not being he is above matter and spirit What He Is We Know Not what that&#39;s why God is\n06:46 - God and if you really speak of God and you want to know his majesty or how Superior he is to the human being yes God has the power to create the whole creation out of nothing\n07:00 - it&#39;s not a subtle thing even that&#39;s why God is God and man is man because man&#39;s understanding stops the sya philosophy proved it thousands of years ago under the Rishi CLE 200 300 years BC 600 Years\n07:15 - BC they said that out nothing can come from nothing only something no matter how so therefore bft of all religion and Cults and Creed I practice a scientific\n07:29 - pathway way to know the truth that is me the physical body is the hand is not me the eye is not me it gets injured it dies decays and death what is that survives that which survives my physical\n07:42 - body that&#39;s my Supreme Consciousness to that end the only purpose of man serun on this Earth is to seek the Supreme indweller the divine indweller all else is secondary details all religions are\n07:56 - secondary details don&#39;t believe unless you know then how do we know practice the necessary means to achieve the necessary Ends don&#39;t push your cult or religion on\n08:09 - others you don&#39;t be my religion I&#39;m going to shoot you these things are happening in the Middle East shocking that man can be a brute\n08:20 - and man can be the God so yoga is a method to transform you it&#39;s a method of transformation it&#39;s an Alchemy of Total Transformation to transform you from man to BR to man the\n08:30 - man to man the god the person The Brute to person the man to person the God help me of Total Transformation I have to talk very fast because I have to hold your attention span that&#39;s why I\n08:41 - did speed up and now since you&#39;re all with me you must tune into my magnetism where pull you to me and you must feel the energy that I&#39;m giving you mind is obsolete it&#39;s it&#39;s about a million years\n08:52 - old discard it like your iPhones you discard every year the knowingness is important and awareness not the mind you go into a library inhale walk out you know the knowledge of the whole\n09:04 - Library mind is very slow and compassive okay next question",

          "transcript": "00:07 - about 10 to 12 years back some astral people approached me and they said that I should teach them Kaa yog but I refused telling them that that is not my\n00:23 - jurisdiction and they should go to some other astral teacher or some other form of uh a guru but it now appears that there's an astral audience so I suppose it's meant to be there I'm meant to sort\n00:38 - of contact them and give them the Shakti path in their astral kundalinis the astral chakras which are pretty vivid so anyway I'm going to begin telling you in\n00:53 - briefly about PR yo it is the science of the evolution of human consciousness I want all you people who are already practicing K yog to have courage and\n01:10 - with courage and steadfastness of mind to pursue this path everything else in the world ultimate leads to sorrow and destruction of your\n01:24 - aspirations if you practice Kaa yog sincerely you will see that no material benefits will ACR from the practice of Crea yog but definitely your inner life will become\n01:39 - richer and more peaceful and full of bliss I always tell my people I said I say that even if you are in heaven and your mind is a hell you are in hell and even\n01:56 - if you are in Hell or in a prison and your mind is bubbling with joy and Bliss you are in heaven so it's not the place which creates a heaven and hell for you it's the state of mind I hope you will\n02:10 - agree with me many of people who go to office who are managers who do business they know this very well that it's their state of mind which is very important more than their\n02:25 - circumstances the mind is a very important thing and by the constant practice of Kaa yog you learn to still the ripples of thoughts in your mind's\n02:41 - Lake both you and I and all of us know that the human being lives in a bedim of misery created by their own thoughts and try as we may we cannot get\n03:01 - a control of those thoughts today I'm going to move into to you to give you my enlightened Consciousness whereby your mind shall be transformed into a state of thoughtless\n03:18 - awareness I shall give this I I intend today's SATs today's Gathering to be shorter than the other days but I will give you the experience cria yog needs to be\n03:44 - practiced as much as one can practice it people have a false notion that it's an advanced technique you're going into a State of Trance you cannot Rel relate with your normal office work this is\n03:57 - wrong this is wrong there are many shortcut techniques which have come pseudo techniques shortcut techniques techniques of just marketing but they leave you in the Lurch practice\n04:09 - the techniques which come from the highest source and Baba is the nameless one he is the lightning standing still called the great initiator he is called the angel of the face of God and yes in\n04:22 - all my 60 years of experience I tell you I've been through the Himalayas I've traveled the world there is no technique like K yog so have courage and Faith practice prya yog with all your heart\n04:34 - with all your soul and with all your strength and you shall find the Everlasting Bliss the Fountain of bliss bursting forth from within you it is a very simple\n04:49 - technique anyone can do it and everyone can do it the only thing is as you Advan I do 12 to 14 hours a day you can do half an hour a day with sincerity it is enough because it's about you it's about\n05:05 - your Evolution it's about your happiness it is not about religion it is not about Dharma it's giving you a tool which you can use to practice on your\n05:20 - own to bring ease and order in your daily life in all its 70 to 80 to 100 years ago existence modern contemporary medicine nor Psychiatry have been able\n05:35 - to produce a single method which would bring ease and order in their daily lives here Kaa yog is the ideal opportunity it is the single method which will bring ease and order\n05:48 - in your daily life and This I Promise You to those who are practicing sincerely I may be in India you may be here but if you think of me I'll connect\n05:58 - to you and give you the Peace of Mind you need this is definite so we must practice sincerely and regularly every\n06:13 - day even if it be for a short period of half an hour then as the sweetness of the practice increases you can increase and sit for 1 hour so this is a very important factor\n06:26 - the other thing is that besides Kaa not being a religion it's a way of life and it can be practiced in a simple form of breathing where you get aware of\n06:41 - your breathing it's a sorry State of Affairs that this great science of yog originated in the land called batsh it originated in the land called India and\n06:54 - now Americans are going to India to teach yoga maybe it is the false yoga maybe it's not the right yoga but still they are\n07:05 - going to India to teach people the false yoga which is quite a shameful thing why our people should awaken the people of India along with their Western Brothers the American Brothers should walk hand\n07:18 - in hand and practice this science of the self it is about you it is about your the evolution of your Consciousness not about your building up your phys physical muscles or using\n07:31 - lavender shampoo on your physical body which is your apparent self your true self is the soul you are not a body and have a soul you are a soul and have a body as a shadow so when you learn to\n07:46 - shift this identity by constant practice by constantly saying every night before you sleep a PR technique is I'm not the body I am the soul I'm not the body I Atma at\n08:08 - I am not the physical body but I am the soul this is the Paradigm Shift You must change this idea that you are a physical body because you're not this house of Flesh and Bone which sleeps decays and\n08:24 - dies you are Immortal Consciousness lord of the earth and the skies so this is a small poem that I I composed I said be rested in the truth o\n08:53 - Yogi that you're not a corruptible body but you are the light of alak n light which is Immortal and everlasting so when you are truly Divine Light when you are the Divine likess\n09:08 - Light how can you have sorrow how can you have disease how can you have depression I'll tell you how you can have it because you are identifying with\n09:22 - your depression your sorrow and your disease therefore you have depression sorrow and disease due to your past Karma if you stop now identifying with your disease depression and your mortal\n09:33 - body and identify with your Immortal body and the Bliss that it has you shall be immortal and you shall be full of bliss why shall you be full of bliss why shall you be immortal because your\n09:49 - nature is saand your nature is sat Anand that's the name for God existence Consciousness and place you do not need to follow any religion\n10:05 - you do not do not need to have any uh purificatory processes or rituals before you practice crio you can do it at any time of the night any time of the day whenever you are on an empty\n10:18 - stomach if you have food you must wait for 3 hours",

          "transcript": "00:11 - so I have empowered you today the Yogi&#39;s touch moves an energy in the spine of the practitioner this is the dynamic energy called the\n00:25 - Kundalini because she arises from the K the bowl at the root chakra is an electromagnetic reservoir of the energy of the universe which is a portion to each\n00:44 - individual after the completion of their individual solar system there&#39;s energy which is left and this energy is tucked away at the bottom of the spine it&#39;s an electromagnetic energy\n00:60 - which is tucked away at the bottom of the spine in three and 1 half coils you know like a wiring in India they do the wiring of the house and all that and there&#39;s excess wire so they\n01:11 - bundle up that excess wire and keep it in the corner and the wall and put it they bundle up that excess energy less it&#39;s required now this is the the bundling of the of the excess\n01:21 - electromagnetic force which is within every human body and it is the birthright of every individual to use this Kini\n01:36 - Shi to use this energy for the evolution of One&#39;s Own Consciousness if Humanity were to evolve in its normal Pace at its normal Pace what is the\n01:53 - normal pace of the evolution of humanity how does the normal Humanity evolve it evolves like this let us have wine women and laughter and sermons and soda water the\n02:08 - day after normally human beings are like this you know you go home you&#39;re tired you know you have a peg of scotch or you have some nice cool beer and a hot\n02:19 - afternoon you do there you you have a nice game of tennis or you go swimming you come back then Sunday comes you feel very holy you go to church and you pray way and then you&#39;re back to your own old\n02:32 - ways again and then you go for True Confessions and you confess that you shall never do it again and then back you are doing the very thing and say I didn&#39;t know I was such a person I&#39;m back\n02:44 - to my own ways my habits are like a pie dog&#39;s tail I try to put my tail down it curls up again I put it down it comes so this is human nature and if we were to lead a\n02:57 - normal life because in India we have no such thing as Vice and virtue or sin or Eternal damnation these are the the phrases of a very nent or childish\n03:12 - religion a religion which is growing out of its infancy like we have Christianity it&#39;s a young religion hell etal we have no such thing as Vice or virtue or sin or this\n03:23 - thing we have the three gas called the satwa Raja and the tun so those who are satk they represent Luminosity we\n03:35 - person&#39;s eating a light diet is always meditating doing good deeds to others we say he&#39;s a satk person he has a lot of electrons in him a lot of Luminosity then there&#39;s another person he&#39;s a\n03:47 - conqueror and he&#39;s very mature or they&#39;re very powerful women also who are very Sports minded and they go and they win gold medals they&#39;re sports-minded and one woman she&#39;s she&#39;s a very good\n03:60 - householder lady she has 13 children which is very good for the country very good for the whole of humanity for them we say they are rajasic person rajasic the quality of the proton\n04:14 - productivity very active not subtle but active and very much leading a good healthy life bodybuilding weightlifting so they&#39;re\n04:27 - rajasic and then we have the other third guy which everybody becomes on Saturday evening or Sunday he is lazy and dull and or he has too much of food and he&#39;s\n04:38 - sleeping it&#39;s all hunky dory that&#39;s tamasic that&#39;s inertia so when we say this person is very inert or this person is very uh active you know activity or this person\n04:55 - is very Luminosity he&#39;s he&#39;s very subtle and L humous so these are the things so there&#39;s no such thing as bad or good or\n05:04 - vice and virtue according to the three qualities which are prevent at the beginning of creation humanity is divided into three different categories a same person can have all the three\n05:16 - qualities in different days of the week or different day different hours of the day now the Kaa yog is a scientific Pathway to self realization and its science its practice\n05:34 - is rooted in the cultivation of love so it has love and intuition as well as a scientific U research and evoltion the will to\n05:50 - practice so will volution and love scientific research and intuitive knowledge it&#39;s a very well balanced technique yogis of ancient times discovered that the\n06:05 - breath and the mind are very intimately linked to one another if the breath is slow and calm the Mind shall the thoughts will be slow and the mind shall be calm if the breath\n06:20 - is agitated and and very verocious ferocious then the mind also shall have a lot of activity and aggression if the mind is very intense in in in\n06:34 - aggression and in fear and anxiety the breath will heave heavily and if the mind is very calm looking at the evening Sunset the breath will run very gently this is the dynamic and great foundation\n06:47 - and contribution of the yogis of India to the world treasury of human health and knowledge the Western science is not uh fully discovered the benefits of\n07:01 - pranayam but they are at a very rapid race and they&#39;re trying to form tributaries and make the pranayam come in their own names like aerobics and this and that they all come from\n07:11 - pranayam it&#39;s all basically pranayam techniques but some people don&#39;t have the habit of giving the credit to the original Founders who were the yogis and they can throw this PR upon a\n07:23 - billion people and give them a transmission where all their backaches headaches stomach aches tension mental aberration will all disappear one Yogi can affect if they are attuned to the\n07:36 - yogi he can affect their mind calm their mind and sooth their nerves which you will see perhaps sometime during the course of these few hours with\n07:49 - me so the yogis developed a precise and rational science of pranayam the AY of pran not the breath controlled but Life Energy controlled breath is like a wire the\n08:06 - life energy is like the electricity running through the wire the breath is like the wire but the pran is the electricity running through the breath so we are dealing with\n08:21 -

          "transcript": "00:01 - [Music] I bow to the indwelling spirit residing in all of us if Earth peace is to Herod the dawn of the new age let\n00:34 - us all realize the soul cry the global ethic that at the level of Consciousness humanity is one and let us all realize that humanity is our uniting\n00:52 - religion breath are uniting prayer and Consciousness are uniting God this may best be brought about by three practical methods which I'm going to suggest to you you here the first\n01:10 - practical method is by the practice of a yogic science called Kaa yog introduced to us by the great mahavatar Baba I have personally practiced the science of the breath as a leaking\n01:24 - vessel never can fill the waters of life so pure and still so distracted mind fails to retain wisdom's nectar in its brain to ease disease of random mind a remedy suitable we must find a rhythmic\n01:41 - breathing tension free with concentration Sovereign key so this is so if we if we you know rather than studying books and teaching children if by yogic methods of concentration and\n01:53 - absorption we can improve the very instrument of the mind it can become a crystal Bowl to gather the of a superal kind and that is the like dog Hammer said that it needs a spiritual\n02:08 - Revolution to bring about a change in the world I second this and we honor his words today he's not with us but his Spirit lives with us today he is the first man who was trying\n02:20 - to link although maybe it would appeared a hopeless task what 50 years ago or 40 years ago whatever and but today it's coming because of the efforts of Dr Sharma Dr Emory MAA being so Cooperative\n02:34 - with us and you find we here to love and live as oness the experience of which I'm going to give you today the means is Kaa yog the second means is we teaching to children everywhere in towns and V\n02:46 - Villages the radi radiating of Earth peace through self Peace by teaching them the Earth peace meditations which is very simple little children mothers we going about this work in our own way\n02:59 - we have no no funding we need no funding and I was speaking to Dr Sharma and she told me don't do that because if they have funding they'll be a little arm twisting so get the funds from people\n03:09 - who flow get the funds from people who are related to you and do it from the heart and I think that was a very good very good advice and I think I'm going to follow that uh so and the third\n03:19 - method is what I'm going to give you today this dear Souls is a very different and a unique way I'm going to directly share with you my Soul Consciousness which you will feel as a\n03:34 - still mind state of abiding calm I'm going to share with you my soul Consciousness we have been able to talk by your grace your receptivity today will determine it's how receptive you\n03:47 - are to that degree you will receive the still mind state of Soul Consciousness you will ask me what good this does this does all the good in the world it's the Sacred Space\n04:02 - it is the language it is the language incomprehensible to thoughts and to words but it's still the language which will transform the world and which will build the bridge between the pragmatic\n04:16 - and practical work which Dr Sharma is doing and the inner spiritual work which I'm doing my heart is filled with joy and I'm laughing because I'm feeling my Oneness with you already and I hope that\n04:26 - you'll cooperate with me and get straight from Words which guide and inform to experience which transforms we've read the menu let's eat the\n04:40 - food B atio I'd like you all to drop all armor and Innovation for the unspoken language which Einstein Albert Einstein talks off\n04:55 - that we need another language to bring about a transformation in this world this language is subtle be aware of it do not sit thinking dear Souls sit feelingly drop all inhibition and armor\n05:11 - and be totally relaxed and tuned to me form the bridge between your heart and my heart get ready for the paradigm shift from Words which advise and inform to\n05:23 - experience which transforms and I am with you when I clap my hand you tune in to me upon your tuning receptivity will depend your experience but I will do it more than\n05:33 - once and I clap my hands and say peace the moment I say that your thoughts will disappear and you will feel a still mind state of abiding calm that's it still mind state of abiding\n05:53 - calm be relaxed drop all inhibition I'm breathing through your breath now I feel myself expanding in your mind relax relax drop the shoulders sit tall drop the drop drop the hands be relaxed and I\n06:05 - you can you can explore my mind with your mind mind my awareness while I aware your mind and I will still it with the awareness of abiding peace and you're with me in tune the Beloved\n06:19 - captive audience form the bridge be in tune and when I clap you will have the still mind State thoughts will disappear and you will find an abiding pee ready\n06:44 - peace the eyes must be kept open explore my eyes they the windows of the Soul shift the Consciousness from head to Heart\n07:35 - if you connect with me the Mind dissolves into Consciousness aware yourself into my still mind State as I share with\n07:53 - you consciousness of an abiding Peace So essentially for the existence of humanity okay come back to your normal State I wouldn't like to say that when\n08:33 - doctor has described all of us rushing around in Manhattan as mild middle class neurotics it's not a very nice uh thing but our Neurosis is cured by this as we go into the stin I'm going to do this\n08:46 - again dear Souls drop all inhibition and armor if you can explore tune in to me don't do your thing do my thing which is nothing and that piece will arrest the Aging forces of your body cells and\n09:03 - bring to light your inner Consciousness because as long as there are ripples of thoughts in your mind's Lake you cannot see the moon of your Delight you cannot see the indwelling Christ because the\n09:12 - Ripple shatter the image of the moon so also a mind which is full of thoughts cannot give you the image of the indwelling Christ so therefore this is a basic thing to sooth the Mind calm the\n09:23 - nerves so therefore I'm going to aware myself into your thoughts as you mind my awareness I will aware your mindfulness and in this exchange if it's empathy you can call it\n09:38 - or if it's sympathy you can call it or an inner synchronicity if you can call it let's do it together this time I'll be GGO suler and subtler then with a wave of the hand then with the wing the\n09:48 - blinking of an eye and then with nothing you'll be so much in tune each time it will be like layering an extra coat of honey on your calmness you'll feel it more and more the second time\n10:00 - deal tune with me explore me do my thing I'm sharing with you the universal consciousness of a still mind State say after me everybody at the level of Consciousness\n10:14 - humanity is one at the level of Consciousness humanity is one the experience of Soul Consciousness brings about Earth peace through self peace\n10:31 - brings about Earth peace to",

          "transcript": "00:01 - almost skeleton like right so I I know what you've seen because it's me who's seeing your eyes what I'm trying to tell you is humanity is one I'm just you I'm just a more developed portion of you\n00:13 - because when I give you the experience I go I go around from here I enter your eyes and I see myself so I know what I'm seeing I know what you're seeing because there is no\n00:23 - difference between you and me so I'm giving you an accurate report I know what I give you and I know what I see through you so when you see this neand tal man when you see the Hanuman who\n00:33 - knows of the the monkey god Hanuman well Hanuman like image is seeing aandal image is seen an ancient that is when yoga first began you're asking me when the yog the science of\n00:45 - yog began not yoga not the aans but the no mind State merging the the soul in the spirit what is yog it's higher than Zen or when or then or anything else of those things yog itself to get into the\n01:01 - highest stage of yog means total communion with God yog means the Transfiguration who's heard of the word the Transfiguration now the Transfiguration\n01:13 - is the ultimate State on the Mount of Olives there was Moses and there was Jesus and there was Elijah do you understand I'm not trying to suggest anything but I'm just taking\n01:25 - you to the state of the Mount of Olives where the Transfiguration there is a Transfiguration which is going on here by the blessings of the Buddha the Krishna and the Christ not\n01:36 - without their sanction is this being done and let me tell you I have not come here to tell you what my religion is or to convert you like Islam did in the Middle Ages or like Christianity did and\n01:49 - they're doing now I have not come to do tell you do that I've come to tell you to follow your own path but remember I have come to teach you a religion called Humanity\n02:00 - if there is any other religion greater than that which is more vastly spread over the Earth do let me know by email email or ww.org okay is that the right\n02:21 - thing they know H so what I am come to teach you is Humanity wants only religion breath once only prayer and Consciousness once's only God\n02:51 - now this teaching is very Catholic it's very vast Catholic mean just means vast it doesn't mean Buddha or Jesus or Mary or Christ or anything it just means the religion that is vast the word Catholic\n03:06 - in Sanskrit means a sanatan sanatan Eternal sanatan has a deeper meaning it means the Eternal unending all other religions the\n03:19 - Hinduism or Christianity or Buddhism or Zen or all fit into Humanity if there were no Humanity then who would you teach who would be a\n03:32 - Christian and who would be a Muslim who would be a Hindu and who would be a Buddhist so humanity is the only religion basically because bond to bond man to\n03:46 - man one to one relig is a Latin or Greek word meaning to bind we are bound that we are human beings that is the most solid binding that you and I are human beings that is\n03:60 - the relig that is what binds us I don't care what the padri the priest the Mula or the Pandit of all religions says I only care to tell you the truth NS the essential existential truth\n04:18 - between person to person the link bond to bond person to person breath to breath soul to soul and heart to heart that Humanity one to one forms the human chain that is the only binding force\n04:32 - between person to person is Humanity not whether he's a latterday saint or whether he's a Seventh Day Adventist that is not important it's all irrelevant\n04:51 - stuff those are the trappings which are brought in to confuse you breath it's only prayer because it is univers i al not only accepted it is universally\n05:03 - done in a constant flow ceaselessly it links the human body to the Divine Consciousness it is a bridge between humanity and Divinity there is no other link between your body\n05:18 - and your Consciousness which is the link is it Hail Mary full of grace or is it a BMW car on the road or is it the clothes you're wearing or is it um Hinduism or is it Christianity or is it\n05:33 - Islam or is it your breath what are you experiencing moment to moment what has God given you which you cannot leave for a moment what has God given you what is that gift you see it is very natural for\n05:43 - a human being to overlook the most obvious like a child can go and remember everything and he's grateful for everyone for everything but not to his mother because he takes his mother for\n05:58 - granted the child will then they because she is already there I mean he will just kick her I've seen many little children just be rude to her abuse her and she'll\n06:12 - still go on loving the child the child will still be rude to the mother because that's the child's prerogative and what is the mother's prerogative to love the child because\n06:23 - the mother's love is unconditional so whether you use or abuse the breath it will still sustain pain your life it is the ultimate mother and what if you neglected your\n06:37 - breath what if one day your breath said okay you forget me I'll forget you today where will you be no way so it's the veritable living mother\n06:53 - of life that is the only prayer and you're knowingly unknowingly advertent in inadvertent ly you're praying the ceaseless prayer of the breath and God made man and God made\n07:07 - Adam Adam means um it is uh in Hebrew and in Persian ancient language it means a dum dum means the breath of life pran and a means incoming\n07:25 - breath and God made Adam and breathed into him the life he breathed into the man of clay he breathed into him so there you are pranayam is started from Genesis\n07:38 - itself how many you read this in Genesis you see it's so obvious so I'm teaching you the very basic teachings from the from the birth of the Bible it starts with the\n07:53 - breath so Humanity one's only religion breath one's only prayer and Consciousness one's only God Consciousness is of the nature of nothingness and therefore you cannot\n08:08 - contradict nothing therefore there will be no quarreling between one religion and another therefore I thought this is the best God to have there will be nothing to quarrel about it will just be\n08:18 - everything to experience that's what what you experience just now a Stillness a Consciousness that is God the Christian believe me can experience his it as well as the\n08:33 - Buddhist or the Hindu or the Japanese can experience it as well as the Chinese and the Caucasian and the Slavs can experience it as well as uh the  race or the Africans or the\n08:51 - Arians Consciousness is always there therefore Consciousness one's only God because it is Everlasting it is immutable indestructible and always there whether\n09:02 - your whether the little fleeting shadow of your body coming for a second and passing by the Consciousness Remains the Same a thousand bodies have I changed from birth to birth but Consciousness Am\n09:17 - I who remain the same forever so Consciousness one's only God the witness in you that's what I am making you exper experience your only God I'm not teaching you any colored\n09:36 - stuff no flavor no color it is your essential self and it is towards this end you must work that's how you must be constant steady not swayed by moods and\n09:52 - fluctuating by negativity there must be Equanimity in everything thing you do",

          "transcript": "00:01 - om namash sh welcome to all the souls the world over today I have an interesting story to tell\n00:17 - you about a little boy who utilized two Mystic friends to attend to God to attain\n00:37 - self-realization and this little boy he was owed with Divine qualities from birth inherent in him and he used to sit for meditation every\n00:55 - day without fail he didn't always always remain a little boy but he started his journey when he was a little boy of three and constantly\n01:13 - meditated and he had to cobble up a partnership between two Mystic friends unite them and use them to\n01:32 - attain God to attain self-realization so this little boy kept on meditating and as he grew in meditation he grew with the\n01:46 - years his innermost core of Consciousness his soul began expressing itself and he persevered as you traveled along the journey some yogis from the\n02:05 - Himalayas they came and gave this little boy the breathing of life and death called Kaa yog and as he practiced his Kaa yog he waxed\n02:27 - strong towards self-realization his inner perceptions increased his Clairvoyance became clearer his clear audience became sharper\n02:43 - because the physical body that the little boy had dawned was being refined by the greatest alchemical science of all\n02:57 - times called Kundalini Kaa yoke which leads one to the final Raj yog that Raj yog ultimately leads you to samadi and then ultimately to nalp\n03:17 - samadi n samadi andala the solitary Singularity the K purush this is the journey of the\n03:31 - soul the little boy was the soul himself his two Mystic friends who were very dear to him were life which he loved very much by the\n03:47 - practice of Kaa yog and the other friend's name was death which was to come to him in any case nobody can escape death so the little boy kept on\n04:07 - practicing and his inner voice the voice of his great mahaguru the spirit of his soul called Shiva goraka Baba kept guiding him and as he\n04:24 - practiced he became more and more knowing of his his true nature of Consciousness every time he went deeper within his Consciousness expanded more and more to subtler\n04:45 - Realms so this little boy who had now become a youth was on his inner journey through ever more refined and ever more expanded it\n05:00 - spheres of Consciousness to get to that goddesses which lay at the core of his own being of course his inner journey\n05:15 - through more and more refined spheres of Consciousness led him to cast off the grosser sheets of mind it was like the peeling of the onion as he refined his mind so his two Mystic friends the\n05:35 - little boy was the soul his two Mystic friends were life and death those two apparently seemed to be at loggerheads and seemed to be poles\n05:52 - apart but then a wonderful Alchemy happened as he practiced more and more and time went by he was able to prolong time in shorter space the space time\n06:15 - continum was being Mastered by the movement of his life breath through K yog it is said that if a person who is on his normal path he practices cre yo then his\n06:39 - Evolution will be one natural year one year of natural spiritual unfoldment a perfected K Yogi will do in half a\n06:54 - minute by the degree of his concentration now what happen happens in Kaa yog is that a human being breathes 21,600 times per\n07:09 - day if you prolong your breath and say for example you only breathe 10,000 times a day and not 21,600 times a day then every day the life you\n07:25 - save is 11,600 breaths if you breathe 21,600 times a day and by prolonging your breath you only in one day you complete 10,000 breaths then you save\n07:42 - 11,500 breaths now this if you save for many many years the life in your Storehouse the life with\n07:57 - you is worth the those many many pronic breaths so life is saved by prolonged breathing and as you breathe every day those breaths when your destined time is over\n08:14 - say 10 million 10 billion whatever your breaths are for 85 years then death comes upon you because life leaves you when life leaves you death is\n08:26 - present when death is overcome life is present so these are the two friends of the Soul which are poles apart they have to be combined to\n08:39 - conquer death and I will tell you how this is done so when you save your breaths every day and you get to your riple date so you're going to die at 85 or 90 when\n08:53 - that time the Call Comes when you're 90 years old Death is certain it will come come upon you and will swallow you you will have to pass through the tunnel of death normal people go and die they\n09:10 - become unconscious subconscious and disintegrate the souls go out from their body but they are not aware of what is happening till their next reincarnation or till they get to higher spheres of\n09:21 - Consciousness but in a Yogi's case his life is there death passes him through the tunnel he passes with say a million breaths of Life say say 50,000 breaths are left\n09:34 - Death is certain okay it has to come so it comes like a tunnel upon the soul but the soul has life through practiced Kaa yog he has saved that up and stored due to Long\n09:44 - breathing he saved up the 21,600 breaths saving 11,000 breaths approximately every day of his life so unless that life is exhausted in him death cannot come so this boy what he did\n10:00 - he kept his life and entered death this is the Alchemy of Total Transformation this is what I want to tell you the story of the little boy the soul who befriended life and death and\n10:12 - was able to utilize them both to enter what is called the state of nalp samadi when death comes to you say at about 90 years of age and you have still a big stock of your PR your life left in\n10:28 - you and you pass through the gates of death the Alchemy is not death neither is the Alchemy of a combination of life and death life neither is the Alchemy of a combination of life and death death it\n10:42 - is a different combination when the yogi full of life passes through the tunnel of death the yogi enters a stage called samadi the stage of thought-free Enlightenment and this is his greatest\n10:57 - victory for he has you utilized both life and death conquered both life and death to become immortal passed through the gates of death conquer life and get to the state\n11:12 - of sadanand self-realization this is the wonderful Alchemy of Kundalini K yog and my dear friends remember just by Steady long breath you can get to this state of\n11:26 - Victory and then you can say oh death oh grave where is thy Victory or death where is thy\n11:40 - sting this is the thing which each one of you can do because Kaa yog is a very simple process anyone can do it everyone can do it so the Alchemy of Total Transformation is a combination of life\n11:52 - and death whereby prolonged breath you can preserve your life when the time of death comes you are still alive when you pass through the tunnel of death the combination of life and death brings you\n12:01 - a state to a state called samadi the state of realization the state of Enlightenment this is the Alchemy of Total Transformation the Kundalini Kaa yog which transforms you from man the\n12:14 - man the brute to man the man to man the god this is the Alchemy of Total Transformation and this you must remember anyone can do it and everyone can do it so come and join the Kaa yog\n12:24 - which is being taught by the Himalayan tradition of shiv gorak sha babaj om Nam sh om namash om namash",

each one according to their own capacity my work is laid out by the divine masters by shiv goraksha babaji shiva path piranha paths and Shakti path and breathing through the Priya breadth of\n00:58 - all my disciples all over the world I will not overstep my mark and do what I am not supposed to do you also should obey your own Sat guru and you have your service to humanity as your larger self\n01:19 - the hamsa Civics can do the earth peace meditation that you will be doing which we are all doing collectively in your own good time then we have the hump such arias who can do the teachings of the\n01:38 - Surya along with the c-bucs who distribute the pamphlets and the hamsa cherries will have teach the SU here and Kriya yoga and we have the pre Acharya who teach the Surya the Priya oh that\n01:57 - yoga mudra and all that is laid down for you if you do that sincerely you are serving humanity as your larger self so each word is laid out in accordance and obedience with\n02:15 - the chain of command whatever is the loving command given by from superiors to the peers anyway getting down to normal things of everyday I'm here doing my physical daily chores I get up in the\n02:35 - morning as soon as I get up I'm gone my state of Samadhi is also unknown to me it is very peaceful because when I sleep in the night I'm always at the astral sphere in my own humble way trying to\n02:51 - serve people alleviate their pain alleviate their fear you know trying to help them coax them guard them and guide them to the extent that I have been permitted by the Lord God open Amash\n03:07 - Shiva and sham goraksha babaji I will not overstep my mark so when I do that in the night I'm working but when I get up in the morning I go from the state of savikalpa samadhi\n03:22 - which is a work state to the state of nirvikalpa samadhi which is the state of pure awareness so in the waking state as soon as I get up I get out of my bed I see the Rising Sun no washing face\n03:36 - nothing nothing just go out inhale Lord Shiva and the auditor idiom sit down and I'm gone in my state my ecstasy of expanded awareness that is the most blissful way\n03:50 - to start the day then after that I come in all then some people say it's good to drink warm water dip in water have some tepid water and after I've finished my meditation of course then I just skip my\n04:06 - morning meals so I have usually I get about 16 hours of fasting then I could be grab lunch directly after lunch I sit down for the news and after some time I used to usually go out see the\n04:30 - carpenter try my hand at carpentry try to do some hobnobbing then go to the Mason build the road that goes up to the temple you know the road that goes from the small bundle to the temple we try\n04:42 - fixing in the those tiles what do you call it those blocks or tiles what are they called tides we tried fixing them and we repaired the road the pathway to the mercury symlink\n04:55 - I used to do that and the afternoon I do it in the morning after my meditation and masonry of course I watched the fellow I tried a few shorts that effort not too good it is although I'm a Mason\n05:12 - but this I a must know the basic masonry starting from the ground won't you see to the building above the temples of the Lord which is your own body to resurrecting your Divine Being your\n05:26 - astral being and your physical being into God's light that's masonry a lot to learn in these simple things of life let me play with the children there we have our the people who are working here at\n05:42 - the ashram and they have lots of little children some of them are adivasis so we ask them how to make the bow and arrow how to make these the Adivasi style of cooking very interesting stuff then in\n05:57 - the evening at 4 or 5 o clock I swim the food is all there for me and I don't know if you can see it on TV or this thing my hair is a little blue due to the excess of chlorine and copper which\n06:13 - is put in the pool but I've gone clean the the leaves which have sunk to the bottom of the pool that's my work and the pool cleaner so I do that and after us when I come back\n06:28 - and of course the work for meditation for earth peace healing through selfies Healing is done in the nights hand in the early mornings during my meditation and that's how the day goes\n06:45 - that's the order of the day and Shivani is there always full of life and we have a lot to do we are still praying I always remember that saying not a single leaf can fall\n07:02 - without the permission of the Lord the rest you can reason out why this virus has come in such a big way and why we are handling it in a controlled way because it is a karmic way and weft it's\n07:16 - like a mini mini Pralay which is taking place and takes the physical bodies of those souls away so that those Souls can go and inhabit higher and better bodies for a better chance of life because you\n07:32 - are immortal nothing can touch you the fire cannot burn you the breeze cannot dry you the water cannot wet you you are the lightless light the immortal soul Allah Quran yong-nam Chanda tshis Rani\n07:49 - nyan on day at the pavakah McClay the aunty APPA associati martha this is what it means so if you are the immortal soul always keep identifying yourself with the immortal spirit which lies at the\n08:04 - core of your being rather than your perishable body respect your body it is a vehicle for the expression of the spirit within and being humble first pray to the Satguru - baba ji and to\n08:21 - shiva and say make me humble a lot and when I do the earth peace healing to get rid of this this virus which is with which we are all the said you come and do it through me and then never mind if\n08:36 - your ego comes and doesn't come first dedicate it to the lord shiva goraksha babaji and then when I say three times and the fourth time is they look up they come\n08:49 - the Sun and blast blasted with your full power because you've already dedicated your earth peace healing to Shiv goraksha babaji and the ego cannot come in the way shiva goraksha our eponymous\n09:01 - toe that is the technique and then with your full ego you can do blasts you can do that that's the way you've dedicate all the actions then the ego will not interfere it to be transformed into his\n09:17 - power not your power that's the technique of doing the earth peacefully through selfies healing and I'm accessible through your breath but the best thing to do is earth peace healing\n09:28 - through 7 P ceiling so do a little bit of the Kriya before you practice the earth peace healing through self P ceiling with the own car technique the one with the closed mouth and the one\n09:40 -

          "transcript": "00:08 - connected i also showed this in the united nations but they told me one thing that we had such a basic stage of just sorting out the quarrels between\n00:18 - countries they said yogi raj you are years ahead of your time but i hope and pray some time we can use this method\n00:28 - then i went to the dog hammershot room of meditation in the united nations i made it they meditated there with shaktipat i charged the room and i prayed for earth peace through\n00:37 - self-peace that's another thing i go around the world holding united consciousness conferences ucc\n00:46 - and when i hold the ucc's like i've held one just now i unite them by the breath and the next thing i give is shiverpath\n00:56 - that is stopping your mind to connect with my consciousness i give you the soul experience of universal soul consciousness\n01:11 - it's difficult to me for me to describe in words because these things are not done you know so when i help them with their thoughts you see why i help them the human being\n01:24 - he lives in a bedroom of misery created by his own thoughts and he somehow cannot stop them i stop them for him or her as a service to humanity\n01:38 - when i stop the thoughts the aging process was also arrested in that moment of time are we able to do that for ourselves is it a learned thing\n01:49 - can we invite it this is the first stage of samadhi of course you can do it but it's much later it comes first you have to do the yam nyam\n01:58 - pranayama you know then yamnium asana pranayama then pratyahar right dharnathyan so now i am giving you the last limb because\n02:21 - in america they say the guru blesses us but we should also check them out they use the words let's check it out they want to check it out they want to check everything out you\n02:30 - know i said okay check me out i don't mind i've opened up game for checking me out but it's interesting that you were talking about um\n02:40 - breath work but in this you know sort of a way what i've learned about your teaching is that you're also saying that is the first step in a way in the\n02:50 - unified field of consciousness if you study you start understanding that there is a fear and an akashic field of\n02:60 - of creativity of consciousness call it what you want god if that's what you believe in is that the work that you're doing you're using the crease and breath work\n03:11 - to sort of allow us a gateway to that it feels like i mean that's the experience i just had yes i'm i'm doing this as a gateway uh because the breath is most important\n03:22 - in yoga it's a it's a solid stepping stone you see when i realized this as a young boy first when i was in in school i was in sherwood and i\n03:35 - had to descend to the bottom of the nanita lake to render assistance in a drowning accident there was another person called bobby myers with me and a\n03:44 - fellow called kenneth khan we were all in the same class just it was some time in the 60s and when i went down my i we had to the water used to throw us off\n03:58 - up after 20 feet we had to go down to 35 to 40 feet so we had a string and a boulder was tied we sat down on the board and went i missed hitting the string i\n04:10 - i missed because i saw this hand underwater and i missed i got nervous because we had to go one by one once to fellow went and the principal took a great risk without asking our\n04:22 - parents he let us down for which later of course they gave us a certificate of courage and all that that was the only thing we were good at\n04:30 - otherwise we were failing all along we used to pride ourselves becoming the last six in the class when i went down my breath left me and i\n04:43 - had to swim up those 35 to 40 feet and that was still eternity i tell you and then a new breath came after i got that state of suffocation and limitation\n04:58 - a new breath came within me and this new breath was the thing that taught me that we a human being has an infinite reserve of prand\n05:09 - when your breath stops there's another thing which is life energy which is called bran which helps you to prolong your life and elongate your life\n05:19 - and it is from then even in school in sherwood i used to sit in the night under my blanket i used to lie down and do my yoga and pranayama of course outside the\n05:28 - yoga and prana we were rascals i used to break all the rules and never be a thing and we were not intelligent people i tell you this i used to not understand\n05:39 - many of these maths and these subjects but how did it come to you i mean you know i've heard that so you're a child and you went into states of altered\n05:50 - consciousness i mean hard you know and now you're so wise i mean you know so many things and these are not things for the average person just to learn you don't\n05:59 - learn these you know this enormous breath of you know what the vedanta is about and just it's not a casual study a lot of it was inborn\n06:09 - and where do you say that you mean karmically or no from the past birth it's a carryover yeah and uh i got to know my mission\n06:24 - immediately after i passed my i passed sherwood and i went in to college and in that gap that's when i left for the himalayas immediately as i finished my schooling\n06:42 - because i didn't really see myself particularly good at anything except swimming and gymnastics or something which i used to take part in i was a very mediocre\n06:51 - talented student i pride myself in saying that i hope you put this on the let them know that even duds can do something you know there's this thing no such thing as it does this is my\n07:05 - frizzle so so you know that's why i'm giving the no mind state and that's the speciality when i'm giving them consciousness\n07:14 - you see what i give in the united consciousness conferences i have created a certain formula through experience and let's say the the the disciple of\n07:25 - student is mind let's call the student mind and that's called the master consciousness so i've made a a a definition that if any mind\n07:37 - is attuned to an undifferentiated consciousness then that mind shall become that consciousness to the degree of its attunement with\n07:48 - that consciousness this is my working hypothesis now i can show you how your mind will become thoughtless and attuned to my consciousness because\n07:59 - mind is full of thoughts yes mind is a train of thoughts a sequence of thoughts is called mind the moment the mind the thoughts stop it becomes the soul\n08:12 - it becomes consciousness and the moment the the consciousness starts thinking it becomes mind so there's a very very subtle balance between soul and consciousness mind and\n08:24 - consciousness are they interchangeable i mean we often speak of them well well yes yes mind and consciousness are interchangeable and mind\n08:35 - has to become very very subtle and nothing at all nothing at all to become consciousness but you see the you have to pass beyond a certain stage\n08:49 - you have to pass beyond a certain stage to get to this mind i don't want to get into this quantum physics and all that stuff although i love that that subject but\n08:58 - your thoughts when you investigate with your thoughts into my consciousness you see that there's nothing in the room there's nothing here\n09:07 - and your what is your mind register it registers a vacuum a no thingness which is actually my consciousness so when i steal my mind and you focus on me and try to get\n09:21 - within me with your mind you try to get within my consciousness your mind is automatically transformed into the consciousness\n09:30 - which i can show you now yes and if the lens and others are watching it outside on the tv or something and if they really sit relaxed and let go they will also\n09:41 - get this first stage of samadhi which is called the mania samadhi",

          "transcript": "00:09 - [Music] one person asked me he said look I'm already receiving Enlightenment I don't need to do Kaa another person says after doing one hours of Kaa I get to\n00:34 - enlightened State another says after doing 6 months of K I get to the state one said after six lives I get so I said the fellow who is at the lowest who gets the enlightenment doing no Kaa and the\n00:46 - high they said why do you say that I said because the state at which you are you can get an Enlightenment in a ignorant State also every chakra at which level are you\n00:56 - enlightened that means your mind is open to the knowingness of that particular Dimension you are in but since you cannot see your own face you cannot tell whether you are in an Earthly simple\n01:09 - dimension of Enlightenment or you are in the Buddha dimension of Enlightenment so everybody mistakes the psychic experience or a plain spiritual experience which they call Enlightenment\n01:21 - everything is Enlightenment you know so which dimension you are enlightened in there you need the guru to tell you that you're enlightened in this it's\n01:30 - Enlightenment there's no doubt about it but which level you are enlightened at this is the question to be discussed and know and if people are confident and ignorant living in the enlightenment of\n01:45 - the naval Center thinking that they are at the transpersonal point I'm sorry there are strict guidelines and rules laid down in the Ki puran the bhavisha puran the bhagat Gita the s\n01:59 - sidhant they tell you these states of higher and higher so don't ever think we don't want a fellow to go far and think he's enlightened and land up in a big blot at\n02:09 - the end of the journey and then say Oh Guru why didn't you want me you should have told me I would have humbled myself I would have gone down and come it was just a state of euphoric Bliss a psychic\n02:19 - State an ecstasy of a Rosy rest but when you Enlighten from the first to the second grade it is an Enlightenment when you grow from second to third grade it's an\n02:36 - Enlightenment but that Enlightenment should not be confused with the field of the Buddha field of the Enlightenment of the isness of the 0 not\n02:52 - Z right that is a totally different Enlightenment they say any old person or any Yogi who gets enlightened who goes into n ADI is it the same as gutam Buddha\n03:03 - samadhi no definitely not because is your Enlightenment an individual Enlightenment is it a family Enlightenment is it a community Enlightenment is it a Humanity\n03:20 - Enlightenment is it a world Enlightenment is it a solar Enlightenment to that degree of the solar system is it a galactic enlightenment cluster super cluster is\n03:31 - it a cosmic Enlightenment or is it the enlightenment beyond for which there are no human words so this is what you must Safeguard against if you choose not to you can\n03:44 - live in a Fool's Paradise all your life be the loser for it these are just guidelines which you have to think of it's not to discourage anyone cple can't see his own face in\n03:58 - the mirror only a witness can tell the the speed of a moving obstacle the driver in the car cannot tell you cannot\n04:15 - experience the movement because he himself is in the car he may get an indicator to the speedometer but he cannot feel the speed at which he's going\n04:29 - at well he cannot judge how fast he's going in relation to a standing object only the witness standing the standby can [Music]\n04:42 - see and no speed there's a correlation point of reference is the earth still object the witness and the Man of Action\n04:57 - so he can tell and experience the speed can visualize the speed so the guru is the Eternal witness who visualizes the speed of your\n05:11 - Evolution and can tell where you are at the human being is like a CH little child how have high have I climbed gurunath hey look at me I've climbed higher look at me I've climbed\n05:24 - higher so people would definitely like to know how high they've climbed to yoga of the East is very subjective and West the Western mind is trained to\n05:37 - approach things objectively from the outside it wants an ephemeral test it wants a test a scientific of scientific progress of yogic progress that which can be\n05:50 - measured the Eastern approach is subjective it can validate it by personal experience but not only is the validation of personal experience\n06:05 - required a guide and a senior Professor if I may use the word is required for the sabatical he takes for his yogic practice to tell him the benchmarks of\n06:17 - where he stands because the master is like the witness the student the disciple is the one involved in the spiritual activity himself he himself is the state so to\n06:31 - stand apart and see it is is more difficult than the person who is already the witness so because it's a subjective state it becomes more difficult to to put it in an objective\n06:46 - language we can try it as far as we like people have described it in the yoga sutras of panjali to take a psychic experience as an Enlightenment is not\n06:57 - Enlightenment because if you see a light or have a you pH Bliss so you feel very Blissful you feel you're enlightened it's certainly not an Enlightenment and people should be cautioned against this\n07:06 - false Placebo because you're trapped in psychic experiences of bliss of euphoria a temporary so-called uh uh uh psychic orgasm which you think to be the Bliss\n07:24 - of samadi so these things should be directed there's bits and pieces of the whole that I do agree their Pathways to the main Eternal Bliss which is\n07:34 - Indescribable because it is Indescribable you cannot uh frame it you cannot frame it cannot put it into words but yes the moment you try to\n07:49 - rationalize it the experience breaks because the rationale or rationalize means to break down to set apart piece by piece a rose looks beautiful only when is a rose when I try to rationalize\n08:02 - it petal by petal and put it apart it looks very ugly so also something should be left for higher qualities than the Arrogant human mind which thinks that it knows everything\n08:17 - which thinks that everything should be rationalized and which thinks that it everything should be done like the man wants to do it they want to see now would you like to see God\n08:31 - the way you want to see God through rationality or would you like to see God as he is what would you like to see God as as he is you would like to see God as he is what would happen if you saw God\n08:46 - scientifically through the manner that you have set forward you the human being comparing with the cosmic God who are you where are you what are you nothing either get lost in your ego or get lost\n08:57 - in God so it's very important not to standardize that it is only called a science if it is in the test tube if it\n09:11 - can be measured in a laboratory no that's not the only way of knowing no there is another way of knowing I respect the human being I respect the energy of the human\n09:26 - being and there therefore it's important to know the true self subjectively rather than objectively so even subjective knowing if repeatedly confirmed by thousands of people becomes\n09:42 - a scientifically valid fact and who set the rules that it should be an objective Laboratory test but we can set the rule that it should be a subjective human\n09:56 - test there are many people many poets and many humble and sincere people who have experienced God in all his love and light and they cannot bring to words because words are very callous they're\n10:08 - very limited so therefore subjective experience of every individual if talled and concurred by 100 other individuals becomes a scientific\n10:22 - fact this I postulate this I say with a great affirmation and this should be so in the future and it will be so that a lot of respect will be given to the personal experience of the human being\n10:38 - the human mind the human soul and the human spirit and if tens of thousands of people tally this experience then nothing can stop it from being a scientific fact we need\n10:52 - science we need it at a particular level but it has its limitations those limitations which it has can be completed by the subjective experience of man who has his own tools of\n11:05 - scientific measurements he has an inner sight he has clar voice he has clear audience he has intuition he has the six chakras a fine laboratory within himself [Music]\n11:30 - can",

          "transcript": "00:07 - [Music] you know with me I'm very bad at visualizing so I could never see the lotus in time it either came late or came too early so what I did I stopped\n00:31 - visualizing I just kept with the practice and by the virtue of my practice I began to see the lotuses I didn't bother visualizing about it I just I just kept going and when I kept\n00:42 - going they came I never tried to see the lotuses I just went on I said God I want no experience nothing I'm not disappointed I'm not appointed neither am I\n00:51 - disappointed I'm just you and I don't care when all these people used to come they get oh I saw this uh you know the blue here and the star there and the Angel flying from here and my guardian\n01:05 - angel came and all I said I'm not seeing any Guardian Angel then some people was after I did my intense ATA they told me you were are the guardian angel that came around us that's what they told me\n01:17 - and they went to some healers and all right and that that healer said oh that this person with the beard is your guardian angel so I but I had no experience but I was becoming a guardian\n01:27 - angel of some other person so this is what it does don't drive for any experience just go ahead with your own job as simple as anything and God will debute to you whatever work you have to\n01:38 - do don't go for the experience and Benchmark I know it's hard when you don't have experience you get tired you get exhausted it's a long long way to Temporary okay but you still got to keep\n01:50 - walking you still got to keep walking and you got to get the rhythm of the walking and once you get in your stride they say in America you get into the zone so once you get into the zone you\n02:00 - reach the goal how do we get into the Zone by constantly practicing day in and day out day in and day out day in and day out and this day in and day out will have many difficulties the damn juice\n02:12 - will Spill the Wine will spill on the table the guests are coming the propane is finished this has happened that let it all happen be Shameless God God God God God God God God God live for God\n02:24 - love for God die for God live for God be God everything is God God God God God God God God God God God God make it a simple agenda what's your agenda God God my\n02:41 - factory is God my company is God my wife is God my children are God I am God you are God the quarrel is God the love is God the hate is God it's God in God and God in God and God in God and God in God\n02:53 - so unless you saturate yourself the damn mind mind is very very very bad very very bad it's very evil it's very it's very bad I'm dead record I think that'll be\n03:13 - censored don't censor the people like it because the mind is like that I had no other word but it does and it nags you it harasses you you know it smacks you down it makes a rag doll out of you\n03:27 - it depresses you but you have to train it and curb it like a wild animal gradually by persistent practice of the time old techniques given by the Masters how do\n03:39 - you expect all your karma some one lady came and told me she said I met one master and he was a tantric master and he just embraced me and I went to Tantra and all\n03:54 - my chakras opened up and I went into samadi I said wow I said all the yogis in the Himalayas who are meditating for thousands of years are damn fools in one minute all the shakras are\n04:09 - open and she goes so I said no no you can't kuruna don't burst my bubble I said I'm not bursting your bubble this is not a state of nirvikalp samadi it's a state of common a good\n04:22 - healthy physical pleasure that's all and you are entitled to a good healthy physical pleasure thank God that you can even have that some people don't even are not fortunate to have that but it's\n04:33 - not samadi we have to have a sense of proportion of what we doing we have to have a sense of although you can be in Sam definitely you can get to\n04:45 - Sam you can get to it by Kaa yoke by T but you cannot get to it unless you practice the K yog day in and day out because the seeds of your karma it's given in my book Wings to Freedom are\n05:00 - encoded in your DNA which lie latent in your astral body of your chakras I've written about my practice and experimenting with how to diffuse these karmas you read that\n05:13 - y I just read wrote it briefly because I'm not very verbose I cannot write like Western authors uh I just I thought I should elaborate on that more yes when we have um experiences like\n05:37 - like seen a vision or see a rainbow body or something like that is that I like Buddhism they say to let let these things come in and let them go I mean how how is\n05:51 - um how how is that a sign of like whether you are rising in in consciousness I mean in the practice actually lady your my mind is\n06:10 - too simple for your mind this is very comp very sophisticated mind I didn't understand the question I tried hard but I couldn't understand could anybody understand the question can translate it\n06:23 - for me could you understand anybody I'll try again okay try she will try herself yeah clear okay I went through a period where you know I had a vision I never had any\n06:38 - experience had a vision of I assume the guru on the mountain with the staff saying you know come on up the mountain and then um you know see see you know like reg\n06:54 - body and things like that but then those those type of Visions kind of went away so is in in Buddhism they say to let these things come and let them go not to hold on to the\n07:08 - experience that's what I'm saying I'm say yeah so it's good you you let them come and let them go that's what we say the father of Buddhism is India where Buddha himself was not a Buddhist Buddha\n07:23 - was one of us the na yogis Buddha practiced under arum so the Buddha himself say said let them come that's our um I think about 10,000 years before Buddhism was born we were still doing\n07:34 - this coming it letting it go don't hold on to it because this is still in the world of Relativity so what has happened to you is a true vision for what it is at your particular stage which is a good\n07:46 - Benchmark it's not a hallucination it's a true Vision okay now are you doing any sort of meditation or practice or have you taken Kaa yog are you doing what did you take Kaa yog before the first time\n07:58 - you're coming I just start cre yog do as meditation also rather it's the same there's no difference there's no difference between Buddhism jism the sanatan yog of Hinduism it's they are\n08:13 - all the same and even if they're different you don't know you flow it's like the colors of a rainbow they complement one another so it's good you've come here and taking because\n08:23 - they're all compliment nothing is contradictory in this world to anything else it's all compliment it's only our minds which are contradictory our minds are contradictory otherwise nothing is\n08:38 - contradictory if approached in the proper manner yes I resp wanted so did I give you an answer so let it come and let it go now you don't have experiences many people told me when they got the\n08:49 - jti mudra they could see the third eye but now they don't see the third eye I said that that's good for you don't see it leave it to him surrender surrender to God\n09:01 - even if we cannot surrender to our wives or our husbands let's at least surrender to God that we can do everybody is holding on what are you holding on for you're holding on because of your\n09:14 - childhood traumas nothing else because at childhood you had a shock so you're you're holding on to your own trauma and then you bash your husband up or he bashes you up or something happens like\n09:25 - that but it's a it's a traumatic thing so the person you can surrender to is God he is the great healer he is the great healer and that's where you must you must let\n09:39 - go that is important yes so I've answered the question that you're on the right path do the Kaa yog don't go for experiences just be sincere in your practice and I\n09:53 - promise you that you will see yourself transforming into the likeness of your own divinity but you don't have any karmic mirrors the guru is the karmic mirror he will\n10:05 - tell you how your aura is growing he will tell you how you're spiritually developing there are many people here who have been through really hard times and they've stuck on so good going keep\n10:18 - it up you were warriors in a past life everybody has been through their bad patch at Hard Times nobody has had you know at huny Dory all the time so good have I answered your\n10:37 - question right so not to get discouraged yes [Music]",

          "transcript": "00:00 - welcome all dear Souls my blessings to you on this full moon day for good and joyous practice and progress in you especially Kundalini Kriya yoga I too had to travel the path and despite all\n00:22 - difficulties I was undeterred in my progress of the Kundalini Kriya yoga not blessings to your it was in the year 1976 that from Pune I made my way to a small village\n00:46 - town 120 miles from Pune it was in the district of mother in a small village called Parker V there is a very famous shiva temple in this village of authority and it is called Mahadev means\n01:08 - the old God the Ancient of Days and I had an intense desire to go and visit this place of north shiva and meditate there and be lost in samadhi although in those days samadhi was intermittent\n01:31 - sometimes I went into deep meditations and sometimes I went into Samadhi depending upon my body condition and the nature of my external work my responsibilities\n01:50 - and yes now this was before I was married so this must have been not in 1967 it must've been before I was married in 72 right so you guys may be knowing and it's in my book means to\n02:07 - pick it up so it must be 1970 and he it was India 1970 of 72 1970 or 70 anyway whatever it was I made my way I took the big red bus in those days the old village buses and windows no window\n02:32 - means open the rest we went there all this public must public transport on the dusty roads I started from Pune and as I went to the village it left me at the main town\n02:43 - another from the main town another had to go to little village but there was no transport to that village so I hired a bull account a paratha is a carriage which which carries you which is\n03:00 - followed by two bullocks so that's a bullock cart I don't mind I brought whether those little carts are provided they must be obsolete there now and so I hired a bullock cart and I went\n03:12 - to this video the driver of the Bullock cart took me there I took my belongings which is just a bundle of few clothes and a bedding should had to sleep on grass mat and as\n03:30 - I entered the village of poverty and exhilaration and a joy came over my heart and I was in carefully abandoned I have no money with me I threw all the money to the wind sister soon as I\n03:44 - hinted this saw the temple of money and I got free of that I only had to close the upper cloth which are more yellow partner like this and a loogie and when offered a toupee\n03:59 - clothes when I entered this village I went to the temple priest and I don't know what accommodation for state so those days a foundation to stairs pretty cheap of fifty cents for a week or\n04:20 - something so I went for 50 cents when we complain even equivalent to Travis and he said of which both rhyme which lineage do you belong to in in any way of religious goodness I said the\n04:34 - vashisht of autre the lineage of the great rishi magista they said oh the ceramic temple on top of the hill go to top of the hill act meditated rocked it I went to the top a the night I was\n04:49 - alone there nor promised temple was there and as soon as I set for my meditation a huge bigger appeared before me that was bigger of an imam and he came and he raised his hand zo put his\n05:04 - hands on his chest and put his chest apart like tearing his chest within which I saw the image of Lord Rama and Sita beautiful Russian beautiful vision not a vision but an actual apparition of\n05:23 - an Amana at that day and so I began my meditations now during these meditations there was one difficulty I didn't go into somebody but there was a thin film of mind in my Samadhi I could clearly\n05:44 - see the vision of the Lord both in his form I could see Lord Shiva and without his form but the thin film of mine Christine there my mind had become a transparent crystal but\n06:04 - it was still mind this could not be removed and try a semi so I carried out my vegetations praying to God praying to Lord Shiva one day it so happened that I went to\n06:29 - wash my clothes at the village went now this is the over dwell where you see Jerusalem 2000 years ago women with their pictures in Beirut and Jerusalem used to go by the way and fill up their\n06:42 - pictures in India this the thing is still prevalent in the vision of villages and some villages they are wells we have even put their pictures on their head India's of course over this\n06:51 - country the world and they go to the village weddin and you know take their pictures film water then whatever it is outside they go to another outer ring and they wash their clothes with a water\n07:06 - drawn from the when I went there wash my clothes but I never washed my clothes in my life so it was a great problem for me I hope we have to close what was the upper garment which is\n07:21 - called the elko corner the shower and then I have renamed when I washed one I bought the other what happened there to my surprise I was trying to figure out a strategy as outlook I should wash my\n07:36 - clothes on the stove by the side of the way a lady appeared she must have been about 70 years of age 65 to 70 years of age and fair with a big forehead and a big tika cuckoo in the center of her\n07:58 - forehead and I could see but I could not see but I could see tremendous dazzle but still she did not give me to know in the beginning who she was my inclusion quite well so I was here and seeing the\n08:18 - meridians still I was able to have a faint feeling but not sure so she came up to me she said oh it appears that you do not know how to wash your clothes you are from families in the city and big\n08:32 - towns way they don't wash it give it to me I will wash your clothes so she took this you have actually related this story in one of my books in wings to freedom or something\n08:44 - she took why do you burn a little bit of clothes that I had and she washed him for me and i i i started like a little child of two i became a child of two in my innocence atlas of majesty but i did\n09:00 - not have the power now the thinking gumption to approach and touch her feet or to class or feet and to say your mother am so blessed you are the divine mother I knew it but I didn't know I\n09:15 - can't explain what state was ever she she so babysitting I was not able to move so she washed the clothes she dried them she dried them and she went behind the clothes like a curtain and then she\n09:35 - removed the curtain of the shawl which she had worn and said now go now do you know how to clean things up and then she put the dirt in back so after that yes and I did run out to her and I thanked\n09:51 - her and she left she walked about 50 yards and went behind some old village huts turned to the left and then adorned and opened a comically that this was the divine mother daughter so I got up and I\n10:11 - ran me right now and I turned to the left and there was sketchy trees it was high desert area and I could just see em she just disappeared there was nobody there\n10:24 - so I just they drowned that might have got the mother of the earth of the road and put it on my forehead and say that blessed thank you mother but this was not all\n10:37 - there was a deeper meaning to this that night when I slept I was thinking of this incident and how fortunate how could I not be like me have the Divine Mother to wash my clothes my dirty linen\n10:52 - like you know I want your linen and garbage I tell you I am the garbage man and you are the cannon but this is sword so she helped me in a way that when I slept in the night that night I had a\n11:10 - deep sleep and in the dream the Divine Mother came in her radiance and glory she was washing the clothes she hung the clothes up and then she she went behind the curtain of the shawl which she had\n11:29 - washed and pull that curtain aside she pulled it aside and said now is everything clear you must know how to wash your negativity and clothes when she said that in my dream the difficulty\n11:43 - in my meditation my mind had moved aside you know I told you I was meditating for half of see Lord human has form and from the state record never see him be on mind the mind had become a crystal she\n11:57 - removed the mind itself and I entered from Sarika to nirvikalpa samadhi and I saw myself sitting up and got into the studio in become Samadhi so this is the outer lesson of the inner\n12:11 - meaning to my life and philosophy so harmony is shiva in feminine form the dynamic energy you need the dynamic energy sometimes she comes in a form sometimes it'll come as energy but it\n12:24 - will help you on the path clear the path so that was my entry that was the penetration of the star which I quote you after that experience what you I went through the tunnel of the start\n12:38 - and then merged into the no mind state the armed mind state from Sarika to nirvikalpa samadhi the thought free state of enlightenment this is one of the great experiences I had in 70 and I\n12:55 - hope this story is like a blessing to you that better late than never and the divine never lets you down this is the moral of the story\n13:06 - god bless God speed [Music]",

have new courage this is where the guilt and fear syndrome should be totally washed out that is the sin the guilt is the sin not the action the act of sex is not a sin but\n02:15 - the guilt that follows it is a sin you should have no guilt otherwise don't do it so these are things which we have no time to waste but if there are people I can just with one thing I can just pull\n02:28 - it out of their head the guilt syndrome and say okay son carry on Blaze ahead you're Divine every soul is divine little boy went and he peed in the ocean and he said ah and then he\n02:40 - tasted the water he said salty ah because of me the ocean has become salty he Flex his little muscle this 2-year-old boy and that's like telling the Divine\n02:51 - mother oh mother I peed on your dress little boy of 6 months old this is how we are who the hell are we trying trying to tell that this is evil and this is not\n03:04 - what what strength does your evil have anyway compared to the vast Cosmic scenario I've told you the width and length of one Galaxy which is smaller than an atom who the hell are we in that\n03:17 - are we even nothing and then because you go and have something you feel in your little syndrome that's your ego which makes you feel that you have you've committed a\n03:26 - sin or a vice or a virtue God didn't come and say that some stupid priests put this syndrome in our head some damn psychological thing has got stuck in our chromosomes and\n03:38 - genes tampered our DNA in the wrong way and we feel for every little thing we do we are sinners totally wrong it's a wrong teaching it's a wrong education the\n03:50 - education of guilt and sin and Damnation I'm sorry it's taught by the church I'm sorry but it's very very very wrong and we have this generation here which is suffering because of this guilt this is\n04:04 - not education education is strength and truth and light you cannot you cannot sin that's why I I make up this big joke how can I eat a plant how can I eat a cabbage\n04:16 - which has an emotion or this thing that's the food chain you're not the Cabbage neither are you the venison or the deer or the lamb eat what you like but don't have a mistaken identity\n04:26 - that you're the body and not the soul you're the soul if the soul is of the nature of the lightless light can it be tainted by anyone spitting on it have you ever tried to go and spit on the\n04:34 - afternoon sun you spit on the Sun what happens it comes right in your eye so you cannot say the sin and all that you should keep to yourself that's very trivial and a childish thing it's very\n04:46 - very childish it's very childlike so have no guilt have no fear the soldiers of light march on smile on camera that's good that's a natural\n05:05 - dive touchdown go on he's giving us a preview of how films should be loaded when the lectur is going on but yet yes yes yet and yet there are good\n05:20 - actions and bad actions no I mean killing somebody take his money or whatever that's kill some body you're killing some body or you're killing some soul some body so body is a body I I'm\n05:38 - not concerned with bodies neither do I give the bodies so much importance in the context of spiritual Evolution except that it's a launching pad for the soul to go up if a body is killed it's\n05:49 - killed the soul will take another body and what are you going to do about it if a body is killed can you raise the body to life then do not cry over spiled milk let's go ahead with a job and while we\n06:02 - are in our good sound bodies let's make the best of it let's make the best of our garments of Flesh the body is is killed and it dies in\n06:12 - action let's pray for it that oh Lord let the soul inhabit a better body the next time let it inhabit a better body so this heresy of separateness this mistaken identity no I I I have a i\n06:24 - wrestle with that to often the direction of so you kiss a lady's lip now if that lady is the next door lady mhm and I come back home now and I wrestle with how poorly I've made silia\n06:40 - feel is that God's thoughts that's having it's mine is aren't they those my thoughts yeah these are your individual thoughts these does that mean I have no particular uh Reon is it okay that I\n06:52 - went ahead and did that this is your individual baggage and you are not God you all are not God you are at Liberty to ask what your individual baggages you deal it and sort it out yourselves if\n07:03 - you ask me a question I'll give it straight and direct that do not bother about these trivialities and do not engage in them also just focus on the light of God why do you have to go to\n07:13 - the neighbor or the neighbor's wife if that's it it's your own doing your action will have its own reaction that's Karma you will be the karma will meet out the Justice I'm speaking that you\n07:23 - should have no guilt or fear don't waste time about things which have gone forget him and get to the clear light don't also mess about in the Tibetan bardu tall that's another piece of nonsense\n07:38 - they take it from the gut puran and some Indian scraps of paper and text which are lying around and write books on that and that's supposed to be a classical text over here it's not it's totally\n07:48 - delusive the B tall is totally an astral psychic limbo psychological state it is not the clear light of divine realization a yogi catches the B by the falls and throws it out of the\n08:03 - window what does the word mean b Bal means the astral State the state where uh a soul marks time before it reincarnates again it's the various stages the lower stages the barar and\n08:17 - when you go to a higher stage you I'm preparing you to go straight to the the heaven of Golden Light H where yukteswar is practice go to a High Evolution that's what you should do don't confus\n08:33 - don't get too mixed up with many things just say oh Lord what is done is done every day I'm born a new I'm starting with the clear light starting with the clear light\n08:44 - start with the clear light all du shall be paid is that the the best way to explain it to a child who's maybe ashamed of something like whether they've been sexually abused or you know\n08:54 - how there's a lot of blocks like that how what's the best way to explain it to a a child why can I ask you something why is a child sexually abused why is one child born with one\n09:11 - leg why is are some child born joined together s your twins I think it may be why is one person born a POA and the other in a millionaire if the American Constitution\n09:23 - says that all men are created equal let's think deep are they created equal there's only one answer to this Karma yes it is karma so if you abuse someone in your past life you're going to get\n09:40 - abused in this life okay that doesn't mean that we should rest at that and not help that child we should but I'm explaining to you beginning why that happens why is a child 6 months old and\n09:52 - you find that it's got cancer I mean what wrong has the child done it's 6 months old it can barely have formative thoughts the poor child is cancer and then after\n10:05 - a short time it dies some children die at 14 with cancer some children die at 6 to 8 years old and they have AIDS and they said that come on I mean 6 year 5ye old child so what is the answer to all\n10:20 - this Karma has the answer to all this because the individual present explains the individual past to each one has allotted his exact and proper task so karma has its uh sway in this\n10:37 - and we go out to help Karma we help the people sometimes we are successful sometimes we are not we do our best this is all we can do and leave to God the rest",

          "title": "The Purpose of Immortality and Crossing the Gates",
          "transcript": "00:09 - okay now let's let's take the American thought of it Leonard said body immortality is very important and we are interested in body immortality it's not surprising because\n00:22 - a large amount of Americans were Greeks in their past lives and they reincarnated from Greece to America and a large amount of the people this is what is this they say\n00:34 - of the Romans the Italians reincarnated into Britain that's why they fulfilled their desire for imperialistic conquests and this and that they did that those very Romans\n00:46 - ital they they they reincarnated anyway that's besides the point the point is people mistake immortality and think that to be the final goal that is not the final\n00:59 - goal and the Fe voice of the Indian rings out because Indians are poor they have no mics no no no Delivery Systems no publicity no awareness campaign so they can't be heard so the Americans go\n01:10 - boom boom they go ahead with the immortality program of longevity of life it's not longevity that we are here for it is Divinity that we are here for longevity is an outcome of divinity you\n01:24 - seek it first the kingdom of heaven seek God and you'll get your longevity then you won't want it also but putting all this aside this was gurun Nat's unasked for\n01:35 - opinion now what we want to know gurunath is about physical immortality how do we get physical immortality how do we get longevity of\n01:50 - body but gurunath we don't know after we get longevity then what do we do we don't know what to do so then again the Indian Yogi comes and tells them look you get longevity to seek God in one\n02:04 - life the purpose of your longevity is just a tool it's a facility it's a servant of divinity to to pray to God to practice more Kaa yog you want a healthy life you want longevity not for\n02:16 - longevity sake not to blow your own trumpet oh Lord give me longevity for Divinity so that I may seek the longevity is just a facility Divinity is the goal but they miss the Mark and they\n02:30 - say longevity is a goal well here's longevity now every human being has a portioned unto him a fixed number of breaths according to his karmic\n02:47 - Destiny 6 million 300 uh you know 6 billion 300 million 5 bli200 million 5 billion 600 million ion whatever the number of\n03:03 - breaths you have that will be your life and that is when the gates of death will come and shut you out because your prab the karma is over for this life is that clear so you have a longevity of 5\n03:21 - billion breaths right am now he has asked how do yogis cross the gates of death in time they know the secret of crossing the gates and here I will tell you the\n03:36 - secret of course because this what I'm going to tell you now is a real eye opener and you say my God is it so easy is it possible but it is like that okay now\n03:51 - the question question which was asked he said how do we know the yogis have the secret to life and death what do they do to cross the gates of death\n04:06 - and yet live what is the essence of this mystery now I'm telling you the essence of the mystery as to how longevity can be\n04:23 - had it appears very simple it's easier said than done but it's very simple it requires determination and persistence now each one of\n04:37 - us is a portioned with a certain amount of breads say 5 million breaths 6 million breaths 10 million breaths after those within those\n04:52 - breaths are contained the unresolved forces of our soul which we call our prab the karma is that clear and only those 5 million or 4\n05:06 - million 66,000 whatever your breaths are you will live to work out your prab the karma that is the karma a portion to you\n05:19 - for this lifetime having finished with which you then depart to the subtler regions casting of your physical body which makes you a\n05:34 - mortal which makes you live a normal life of 70 80 90 years whatever was destined to you now what happens is when you practice the Kaa\n05:50 - yog you are apportioned say five million breaths normally we breathe\n06:04 - 21,600 breaths every day in 24 hours so a normal human being who is breathing 21,600 breaths will live a life say these are all examples I'm not being perfect in the numbers say live 80\n06:22 - years or 75 years now what happens when a person does Kaa yog he lengthens each each breath so when a normal person takes 21,600 breaths a yogi who is doing Kaa\n06:38 - yog may take only 9,000 breaths do you understand so now he has a great backlog and in those 9,000 breaths his karma is burnt very very\n06:56 - fast but his life remains because that much number of breaths remain every day if it's 21,600 breaths and he takes about 10,000 breaths so 11,600 breaths he carries to the next day that means\n07:12 - his the backlock keeps accumulating and his breath that much of breaths are already there so he cannot die unless he finishes that much amount of breaths he cannot die so when the G but\n07:28 - death comes at the time it has to come right so when death comes it gives you death but since your life is still there you go into death but then you don't go into death that death is called\n07:47 - samadi yes you can clap that that that requires a clap you didn't understand they didn't understand otherwise they would all clapped you understand if I'm Brea if\n07:58 - I'm only allow 21,000 600 breaths after that I die in 21,600 breaths in one day for example but in that day unless I finish 21,600 breaths death will not come to me\n08:17 - by Kaa yog I a normal breath they take how many breaths you take per uh uh minute 16 12 16 to 32 breaths per minute right a\n08:32 - normal breathing person 32 breaths here you are taking four breaths per minute so un those that breath is still remaining and 21,600 breaths the time is 24 hours after 24 hours death comes 24\n08:51 - hours death comes it gives you death but life Still Remains with you breath is life right so that lengthened breath is still life with you so so you pass through the gates of death you\n09:02 - assimilate death but you are conscious that is called samadi got it right that's why you should do Kaa yog and that's how the the great yogis and\n09:14 - the great sages W of death it comes to them every time and they say wait a minute not now not now does that make scientific sense so suppose you had in 24 hours\n09:29 - death was going to come to you you had to finish that prab the karma now it's karma and death you have to finish that Karma off that much breath you don't finish it you\n09:40 - pass through the gates of death in Consciousness so conscious death is sadii conscious sleep is sadii you go into samadi when death comes others die and they cast their\n09:52 - bodies but you go into samadi because you still have life left in you because you have lived 10,000 breaths where you are supposed to have lived in 24 hours 21,600 breaths you are\n10:04 - only living 10,000 breaths so you still have at the end of the day of 24 hours you still have 11,600 life breaths so death comes at that particular time you still have\n10:16 - breath so you you conquer death and you pass the other side now the question is how do you pass you pass in a state of samadi when death comes to you and and you're breathing the long breath death\n10:32 - is the factor which gives you sadii no breath and still the life is there with you you go into samadi cross the gates of death and then continue with your breath yes any questions I have two\n10:47 - questions the first one is so when Mark and Mark and day is on the shivling is he at that moment cuz he's crying out to Shiva but is he is he basically breathing the the the an exceptional\n11:02 - extraordinary duration of Kaa yog and that's really what the the soul cry is for marand is this just well in Mar's case what comes to mind immediately that he is not in a state of doing Kaa yog\n11:17 - he's not doing Kaa yog he's already in samadi he's already in samadhi means he has to prolonged Kaa yoga accumulated that much life if he has not which appears as for the image because\n11:32 - then he would not need Lord Shiva he by his own K yog death would pass him and he would go in samadi but Lord Shiva came as a special Bo that means the life the samadi of Lord Shiva was Heavy upon\n11:47 - him when death passed death is call Shiva is mahang death is time Shiva is the great beyond time so marandi had crossed the SpaceTime Continuum and gone into the\n12:04 - great beyond time so he was faster than light Back to the Future [Applause] Beau so my second question and and even breathing normally because the work\n12:22 - you're doing on us is so significant even in the satson especially in the SATs yes then is this this breath even just the normal breathing that we're having is this demarcated or does it\n12:35 - change is the is the Vitality or substance of it Chang if the guru is the sguru and if he is what you people see him as then definitely he increases your quality of breath and prolongs your life\n12:47 - because he puts his pran his life in your breath that's why I say satsang with the guru is way more important than any Crea meditation when the sguru is there if\n12:58 - he's not there then you continue with with your ca meditation so this is the secret how they pass the gates of death death in time because they they lengthen their\n13:08 - breath and by they L lenging their breath they shorten time they lengthen the they they they lengthen their breath and they overcome time",

spiritual what is life about who is God anything whatever what is God what is not good so that's exactly what I'm about to do and I'm about to have a conversation with a most incredible\n00:31 - self-realized yoga master called yogi Raj said the North Gurunath he is of the gorakshanath Babaji lineage of the himalayas super excited stay tuned [Music]\n00:53 - phenomena god bless thank you so much for making this time for this amazing conversation that we're going to have and I fully aware that not many people get an opportunity to have a question\n01:07 - answer session with a real live in flesh self-realized yoga master so I'm very much aware of the privilege thank you so much so I have a number of questions for you and the first one that I want to\n01:21 - kick off kick off with is as a living Yoga Kriya yoga master how would you describe Kriya yoga to the layperson [Music] well Kriya yoga is a simple science of\n01:39 - life energy control I would describe it as a chronic meditation a meditation done with Rana there are two currents in the body bran and upon the pranic current flows from\n02:00 - the base of the spine up to the third eye it's a unifying and evolving current it evolves consciousness and the apana current first from the third eye down\n02:15 - the spine to the base to the hoop chakra this apana current burns all negativity and past evil karma at the physical level you can say it's a rejuven detox technique the pranic upward flowing\n02:34 - current of bran rejuvenates the body cells and the downward current of a pan destroys all negativity and toxins in the body so rejuven detox technique at the physical level at the spiritual\n02:48 - level the upward breath of pran evolves consciousness and the downward breath of a panic current burns your past evil karma this is a simple way of describing\n03:01 - Kriya yoga and I always tell my disciples one thing it's very simple the just as the gentle abrasion of River transforms all the stones into the form of a Shivling it rounds them off so also\n03:20 - the gentle abrasion of Kriya yoga wears away the rough edges of the personality and makes of every Jeeva a Shiva so the practice of the gentle abrasion of breath the constant moving of the breath\n03:34 - transforms Jeeva and tashera this is the efficacy and the importance of Kriya yoga it is simple anyone can do it and it is meant for everyone simply put how would you describe prana\n03:53 - for the layperson well prana is an internal energy of the body in Englishness for lack of a better word they call it life force you know in these movies and all you see may the\n04:10 - force be with you and all that when they say that the force be with you that is they very new to the world version of priam so they call it force it's a force a dynamic energy that's what promise is\n04:26 - associated with and they say that pran permeates the whole universe from the smallest atom to the vastest galaxy is animated by brawn the exhalation of creation the exhalation of the creator\n04:43 - and the inhalation which gives life pran vivifies nature brand puts life into inert matter and therefore pran is the basic substratum of the living nests of creation that's how I would describe it\n05:06 - contained in pron that makes it such a force for evolution the essential element for evolution poisonous you see now the outermost the outermost form of bran is the breath\n05:25 - which we can compare to the electric wire then Brown itself we can compare to the electricity which runs in the electric wire so just as the electricity runs in the electric wire so also pran\n05:42 - runs through the breath to give us life and behind pran is the light of living Ness we associate with a direct Shakti the direct divinity of God the dynamic\n06:04 - Shakti the dynamic energy of God so behind pran is that living nests of light pran is half terrestrial the middle portion of pran is celestial and the source of pran is divine\n06:26 - so pran has is a bridge between the humanity the celestial regions and divinity and therefore pran is very important in the evolution of the human being as a whole and human consciousness\n06:46 - specifically and so so what you're saying is there's a consciousness that is infused in the breath that we take that is directly at the same time celestial at the same time divine and\n06:60 - that is the thing that gives us life and that is the thing that gives us healing intelligence as it were like a cosmic intelligence carried in the breath would that be the way to say it yes\n07:11 - the cosmic intelligence is infused into the force the life energy of prawn and prawn itself lends motion to the breath and breath itself moves in the in the body through his lungs to animate the\n07:31 - body - its living activities therefore when we take medicine so when we take tonics the medicines are not healing you it is the pran which is the master Mason\n07:45 - which builds your body cells and the body doctor so the Master Mason and body doctor of healing is pran and not the medicines the medicine is just the pran works\n07:59 - through the medicines the medicines are a catalyst they make pran available they invoke pran and the pran heals your body and the pran evolves your consciousness so\n08:09 - this consciousness can relate directly with pran and celestial energy rather than directly with matter it is through pran which is a bridge between humanity and divinity the bridges pran so is it\n08:24 - the intention of an individual that makes fron work in one way and not another way so for example we're all breathing all day long without breath Medina so what is it that makes the\n08:37 - breath and the intelligence in the breath the divine and the celestial intelligence in the breath of work to evolve or to heal a person as opposed to just a regular keep me a life kind of\n08:50 - breath you know just just keeping me going kind of business lights on as usual what's the difference so the difference is that when you're breathing normally pran is moving your breath\n08:60 - normally but when you want to direct pran for a specific purpose it is intent that matters which I call the Faculty of exclusive attention if you apply to your breath moving then that concentration\n09:20 - that Faculty of exclusive attention will draw the pran to that particular spot of place which needs to be healed so the degree of concentration applied upon the degree of concentration applied will be\n09:36 - your success in pranayama whether it be for self evolution or whether it be for healing or whether it be for healing others the degree of focused attention is important to achieve the\n09:55 - results but after a certain stage when you are so focused the attention snaps and you're floating in that focused Ness you're focusing effortlessly without focus that Hana or concentration becomes\n10:12 - the yarn and when you go into a deeper state of the heart away of effortless focal focus makes you forget yourself and you become the object that you're focusing on that is called Subba culpa\n10:27 - Samadhi and when there is no object to focus on and you're focusing on the divine awareness with nothing as its object and you have lost body consciousness that is called nirvikalpa\n10:40 - samadhi samadhi without any vehicle these are the states and so so for a person any of us the important thing than to develop as a as a faculty in our own practice is the ability to not doubt\n10:59 - to be super clear about what's possible when we put our mind to this because the breath will do the rest and so really what I call the mind monkeys to find a way of taming the mind monkeys right the\n11:11 - things that keep us from jumping around in the mind that's really what it comes down to it the most basic level and then to kind of become what yeah I've heard you call in no mind that's a much\n11:22 - further evolution but even now it's a it's a really a practice sort of taming the mind monkeys you know not doubting and not disbelieving yes these are preliminary things firstly a person who\n11:41 - doubts and disbeliefs will not come to practice yoga he won't come to an ashram because he'll be having his own ideology whatever it is car racing or gambling or you know just\n11:55 - going for exercise but the people who are focused on this have that confidence and have already know the import of yoke they know the import of yoke what is the value of yoke and\n12:08 - they have no doubt that evolves them that it evolves them from man the man to man the brute to man the god women the women the brute to women the woman to woman the goddess you have to include\n12:21 - both so this is very very important now talking about the mind Bucky your mind is here monkey I give the mind monkey work by Kriya yoga the mind is the monkey so I make him go down with the\n12:39 - downgoing breath and I make the monkey go up with the upcoming breath till all the distracting thoughts so we give the monkey some work of climbing up and down the pole and we tire the mind up and\n12:51 - down and up and down till the mind gets exhausted and no distracting thoughts come and only the chaitanya pran is moving up and down the central column of that absolutely got it give the monkey\n13:06 - the MA again give the monkey work there's a monkey [Music] [Applause]",

          "title": "The Purpose of Immortality",
          "transcript": "00:11 - now let's let's take the American thought of it Leonardo said body immortality is very important and we are interested in body immortality it's not surprising because\n00:23 - a large amount of Americans were Greeks in their past lives and they in reincarnated from Greece to America and a large amount of the people this is what is this they say of the Romans the\n00:36 - Italians reincarnated into Britain that's why they fulfill their desire for imperialistic conquests and this and that they did that those very Romans it'll lead they they reincarnated\n00:50 - anyway that's besides the point the point is people mistake immortality and think that to be the final goal that is not the final goal and the feeble voice of the Indian rings out because Indians\n01:03 - are poor they have no mics no no no delivery systems no publicity no awareness campaign so they can't be hurt so the Americans go boom boom they go ahead with the immortality program of\n01:14 - longevity of life it's not longevity that we are here for it is divinity that we are here for longevity is an outcome of divinity you seek first the kingdom of heaven seek\n01:27 - God and you'll get your longevity then you won't want it also but putting all this aside this was Gurunath son asked for opinion now what we want to know Gurunath is\n01:39 - about physical immortality how do we get physical immortality how do we get large evety of body but goodness we don't know after we get to longevity then what do we do we don't know what to do so then\n01:58 - again the Indian yogi comes and tells them look you get longevity to seek God in one life the purpose of your longevity is just a tool it's a facility it's a servant of divinity to pray to\n02:13 - God to practice more Kriya yoga you want a healthy life you want longevity not for longevity sake not to blow your own trumpet oh lord give me longevity for divinity\n02:24 - so that I may have seek the longevity is just a facility divinity is the goal but they missed the mark and they say longevity is a goal well here's naivity now every human\n02:37 - being has a portion and to him a fixed number of breaths according to his karmic destiny six million three hundred you know six billion three hundred million five billion two hundred million\n02:57 - five billion six hundred million whatever the number of breaths you have that will be your life and that is when the gates of death will come and shut you out because your prarabdha karma is\n03:14 - over for this life is that clear so you have a longevity of five billion breaths right up now he has asked how do yoga is cross the gates of death in time they know the secret of crossing the gates\n03:33 - and yeah I will tell you the secret because this what I'm going to tell you now is a real eye-opener and you say by God is it so easy is it possible but it is never okay now the question question\n03:57 - which was asked he said how do we know the Yogi's have the secret to life and death what did they do to cross the gates of death and yet live what is the essence of this mystery now I'm telling\n04:17 - you the essence of the mystery as to how longevity can be had it appears very simple it's easier said than done but it's very simple it requires determination and persistence\n04:36 - now each one of us is apportioned with a certain amount of breaths say 5 million breath 6 million breaths 10 million breaths after those within those breaths are contained the unresolved forces of\n04:57 - our soul which we call our product the Karma is that clear and only those 5 million or 4 million 66,000 whatever your breaths are you will live to work out your problem the Karma that is the\n05:18 - Karma apportioned to you for this lifetime having finished with which you then depart to the subtler regions casting of your physical body which makes you a mortal which makes you live\n05:37 - a normal life of 70 80 90 years whatever was destined to you now what happens is when you practice the Kriya yoga you are apportioned say 5 million breaths normally we breathe 21600 breaths every\n06:07 - day in 24 hours so normal human being who is breathing 21600 breaths will live a life say these are all examples I'm not being perfect in the numbers say live or die eight\n06:21 - years for 75 years now what happens when a person does Kriya yoga he lengthens each breath so when a normal person takes 21600 breaths a yogi who is doing Kriya\n06:38 - yoga take only 9000 breaths you understand so now he has a great backlog and in those nine thousand breaths his Karma is burnt very very fast but his life\n06:58 - remains because that much number of breaths remain every day if his 21600 breaths and he takes about ten thousand breaths so 11600 breaths he carries to the next day that means is the backlog\n07:14 - keeps accumulating and his breath that much of breaths are already there so he cannot die unless he finishes that much amount of breaths he cannot die so when the gate but death comes at the time it\n07:30 - has to come right oneno soho death koto wa yanha kar sakta so when death comes it gives you death but since your life is still there you go into death but then you don't go into death that death\n07:45 - is called Samadhi yes you can clap that that requires a plan you didn't understand they didn't understand otherwise they'd all clap do you understand if I'm breathe if I'm only\n07:59 - allowed 21600 breaths after that I die in 21600 breaths in one day for example but in that day unless I finish 21600 breaths death will not come to me by\n08:18 - Kriya yoga a normal breath they take how many breaths you take per minute sixteen twelve sixteen to thirty two breaths per minute right a normal breathing person thirty two breaths\n08:35 - here you are taking four breaths per minute so unless those that breath is still remaining and 21600 breaths the time is 24 hours after 24 hours death comes 24 hours death comes it gives you\n08:54 - death but life still remains with you breath is life right so that length the breath is still life with you so you pass through the gates of death you assimilate death but you are conscious\n09:04 - that is called Samadhi got it that's why you should do Kriya yoga and that's how the great Yogi's and the great sages warn of death it comes to them every time and they say wait a\n09:18 - minute not now not now does that make scientific sense so suppose you had in 24 hours death was going to come to you you had to finish that problem the Karma\n09:33 - no it's karma and death you have to finish that karma of that much breath you don't finish it you pass through the gates of death in consciousness so conscious death is Samadhi conscious\n09:46 - sleep is Samadhi you go into Samadhi when death comes others die and they cast their bodies but you go into somebody because you still have life left in you because you have lived\n09:59 - 10,000 breaths where you were supposed to have lived in 24 hours 21600 breaths you are only living 10,000 breaths so you still have at the end of the day of 24 hours you still have\n10:11 - 11,600 brain liability breaths so death comes at that particular time you still have breath so you you conquer death and you pass the other side now the question is how do you pass you pass in a state\n10:25 - of Samadhi when death comes to you and your breathing the long breath death is the factor which gives you some Adi no breath and still the life is there with you you go into Samadhi cross the gates\n10:40 - of death and then continue with your breath yes any questions I have two questions the first one is so when Mark and Mark and day is on the ship Ling is he at\n10:55 - that moment lit because he's crying out to Shiva but as he is he basically breathing that the an exceptional extraordinary duration of Kriya yoga and that's really what the soul cry is for\n11:08 - marking day is this just well in markedness case what comes to mind immediately that he is not in a state of doing Kriya yoga he is not doing Kriya yoga he is already in Samadhi he is\n11:22 - already in Samadhi means he has to prolonged Kriya Yoga cumulated that much life if he has not which appears as per the image because then he would not need Lord Shiva he by his own creative death\n11:36 - would pass him and he would go in Samadhi but Lord Shiva came as a special booth that means the life the samadhi of Lord Shiva was heavy upon him where death\n11:49 - past death is called she was Mahankali death is time Shiva is the great beyond time so mark indeed crossed the space-time continuum had gone into the great beyond time so\n12:07 - he was faster than light back to the future so my second question and and even breathing normally because the work you're doing on us is so significant even in the satsang\n12:26 - especially in something yes then is this breath even just a normal breathing that we're having is this demarcated or does it change is that is the vitality or substantive if the Guru\n12:39 - is the South cooler what if he is what you people see him as that definitely increases your quality of breath and prolongs your life because the he puts his broad his life in your breath that's\n12:51 - why I say a satsang with the Guru is way more important than any clear meditation when the circle was there if it's not there then you continue with your career meditation so this is the secret or the\n13:03 - pass the gates of death death in time because they elected their breath and by the length and I think their breath they shorten time the Leighton said maybe they elected their breath and they\n13:20 - overcome time",

raise the dead then it's a hallucination if you imagine that you are christ and that you if you if you imagine they are christ then you can raise the dead and you go and you do raise the dread you\n01:00 - are christ simple so this does not happen with a mind divided amongst itself or ill it is with\n01:10 - itself see next question yes i started my own path about 30 years ago\n01:25 - it was it was in a traditional yoga community and then something happened and then i felt away\n01:36 - and i started again about 10-12 years ago with an advising path sort of a and bite out form of buddhism and\n01:48 - basically in that catholic it says that we already are self-realized right now and all we have to do is have a paradigm shift and practice isn't necessary if you want to do practice you\n02:01 - can do practice and common mind but it's but there's no seeking what you already are that's exactly what i told you you put the hands of your mind upon the eyes of your soul and cry that you cannot see\n02:13 - take the hands away and this saying that you already are and all are a misnomer because who was buddha was buddha a buddhist he was an hindu like us just to get\n02:27 - things i don't believe in hindu and buddhism but just to get things right he was taught by masters in india and the mind tends to be lazy you don't have\n02:37 - to do anything you're already enlightened okay come on here you are if you're already in right and raise the dead man turn the water into wine like jesus did and if he could do it and you\n02:46 - couldn't what's missing he was just showing off simple maybe he is but he to raise a dead man to to alleviate the suffering of people i mean it's a great thing if it should\n02:59 - if it show off it must be god make me a show off like this that i can alleviate the sufferings of people i'd like to be a showoff who could who could pacify the hunger 5\n03:07 - 000 people with two loaves of bread and five fish god make me such a show off or make me such a devil let's say he's a devil i'd like to be a devil who does good to humanity i would like to be a\n03:17 - god who kills brutally millions of people so it's just a question of my mere dialect my dear friend the essential fact is the essential fact can you take it\n03:27 - it's not in the words it's in the deeds okay so this that you are already enlightened please\n03:39 - do not deceive yourselves if you are enlightened so am i okay now today in his words i'll be showing off okay i'll be showing off to you because i'm\n03:52 - trying to give you an experience and earnestly from your heart trying to make you realize that at the level of consciousness humanity is one by stopping the thoughts but there's\n04:02 - some skeptics who say okay i'll see how this fellow stops my thought of course who the hell bothers if you're going to resist i'm not going to make an effort but\n04:10 - the living proof will be all of you will raise your hands and so that is the thoughts are stopped so these are juxtaposing and playing fiddling around with word\n04:20 - the mind that's making a mess the mind makes a big mess a bosch so you have to make an effort one person came to me\n04:31 - i was just meditating normally because i i like it i was enjoying the briefs and i floated off into a state of divine bliss so he told me hey yogi what are you\n04:39 - doing no need to meditate god says there's no need if it's if it's god's will then you'll be enlightened\n04:48 - otherwise you won't so i said listen it's god's will to keep you dumb and criticizing others and it's also god's\n04:58 - will to give me this state of bliss so both even meditating or making an effort is god's will why does it work for one and not for the other\n05:08 - you're already enlightened okay and you're in still in that state of dumbness then for that case isn't a madman enlightened also\n05:17 - with schizophrenia why is he suffering so there's an enlightened sufferer\n05:25 - there's an enlightened divorce debauch there's an enlightened terrorist there's an enlightened good man there's an enlightened enlightened being so now by the practice of kriya yoga\n05:36 - from an enlightened terrorist you can become an enlightened enlightened being if it's words you want to play with i'm ready for the game of chess can you all dig it\n05:48 - you see because buddhism we know that it definitely originated in india and the teachers of buddha were not yogis it's not that\n05:60 - those folks are not enlightening that they embody them for that understanding on the conscious level its enlightenment is beyond understanding\n06:10 - so for thousands of years people are being tried to prove enlightenment of god and they have failed for thousands of years people have tried\n06:21 - to disprove enlightenment and god and they have also failed so enlightenment of god is not a subject of intellectual speculation or discussion it is a\n06:32 - subject of practical experience right now when you meditate and rise above the lake of mind you are in a very peaceful state\n06:41 - suddenly public are bubbling up from the surface of the mind's lake a thought comes you know\n06:50 - this thought is latent in your memory banks the the process of meditation is clearing your memory banks of the garbage of stored impressions there are three things your minds have\n07:03 - one is random thoughts one is a thought form that's ideational a thought form this is which is a visual\n07:15 - it's an audio visual and the third thing is stored impressions of thought forms so first of all when you start meditating your random thoughts get\n07:25 - scattered and you have a peace of mind then as you go deeper and deeper these other thoughts which are with forms you know first you just have a thought like a clock there's that\n07:35 - it has a form it doesn't have a form then you then you have a form of a beautiful house or a beautiful uh person you were in love with he will come the thought will come it will\n07:47 - surface from your from your mind's lake it will bubble up to the surface and then after you finish with that many years later when you're established in a perfect state of meditation\n07:57 - still thoughts will come their past life their latent impressions stored impressions of past lives and many many years back then they will come to the surface let them surface and let them\n08:09 - pass away then when your memory banks are emptied then you will see the crystal light you see everybody is enlightened here's a flame\n08:18 - okay everybody has the flame i have told you that knowing not that your body is a temple of the god and the spirit of the lord\n08:27 - dwelleth therein but the curtain is of the mind now you cannot realize your\n08:36 - this flame cannot unite with the universal flame because of the coverage of the mind this coverage it may be thick it may be thin if it's\n08:45 - thin people see get enlightened quicker if it's thick it takes a longer time but it takes its cleaning of the lamp glass your mind does the lamp glass if it has a lot of suit\n08:57 - everybody has the flame inside everybody is enlightened but the lamp glasses like the suit on top aye so it's cleaning the lamp class if you have a lot of suit you have to practice\n09:07 - more meditation some people come and they get married enlightened at the age of 18 like santa maneshwar nanesh was a great or ramana maharishi at a very young age he got enlightened\n09:17 - because there was less suit so each individual gets his the awareness of his enlightenment is god depending upon how fast you clean your mind everybody is enlightened but\n09:27 - the awareness of whether he is enlightened or not will depend upon the mark and the bosch which the which the emotional luggage that you carry and that is your karma\n09:37 - unless you work out all your karma you cannot be enlightened although you are all in potentially an enlightened being vivekananda says each soul is potentially divine\n09:46 - to express this divinity is cleaning of the land class how will you clean the mind how would you take the hands of your mind away from your consciousness and make the individual conscious flame\n09:57 - merge in the universal conscious blame we are always an individual conscious blame we are always enlightened but the karmic flow the karmic mind\n10:08 - thick with karma vision of our awareness of we being united with the universal flame of light that's that explains it but i got its way\n10:19 - right so we are all enlightened the soul is all within us i said it knowing not that the flame of god is within you but the mind\n10:27 - the damn mind comes in the darn mind and that mind is a ceaseless flow of your karma you can't just say let us have wine women and laughter and enlightenment the\n10:41 - day after no your your wine women and laughter your wine men and laughter is going to create an impression upon your mind substance which is called the mind stuff\n10:55 - the stuff of the world is mind stuff the stuff of the world is mind stuff now this karma has to be worked out otherwise you will not be aware that you are enlightened and connected with the\n11:08 - universal enlightenment although you are the flame of god death burning you are divine you're not only enlightened but you're divine\n11:17 - but that divinity individual divinity to merge with the universal divinity the curtain of the mind has to be melted and that can fastest be done by kriyayo\n11:28 - is that clear now all right okay",

          "transcript": "00:09 - see what you must do is while you're sitting now this whole room is flooded with healing energy each one will take according to his\n00:19 - let go you know when you let go you're sitting like this sometimes this happens suppose you're sitting like this yeah you're sitting like this and your\n00:29 - elbow your shoulders then your jaws drop you don't know that you carry a tension in your mind and muscles if you relax that\n00:37 - the energy which is surrounding me is shared with you so already a healing transformation is happening\n00:46 - healing transformation is happening moment to moment so please relax don't have any preconceived motions it all comes from the divine i'm transmitting this\n01:01 - yes i had a two questions yes um so what is yeah what is the best way to\n01:11 - get into divine presence okay what is the best way to get into the presence divine you are already in the presence divine\n01:27 - let me start within this body the satguru is dwelling whose energy you can feel which is the divine energy it's not his\n01:40 - everything is divine what you have to do is to let go there is a similar germ of divinity in your heart\n01:53 - once you relax and let go the satguru's divinity your divinity contact one another and then it contacts the divine divinity\n02:02 - divine divinity is satguru divinity and your individual divinity combined you will be living in the presence divine this is the meaning of ishvar pranadhan\n02:18 - people think that ishwar pranadhan is just dedicating to the guru and the master and this is no it's a placing your consciousness with the assistance\n02:30 - the sadhguru is the server of humanity he analyzes you and helps the novice to place it in the divine consciousness so this is living in the presence divine when you think make an effort\n02:47 - you constantly keep forgetting i am not this house of flesh and bone which sleeps decays and dies i am immortal consciousness lord of the earth\n02:57 - and skies you should constantly to live in the presence divine you have to do vivek you have to remind yourself i'm not the corruptable body i'm the divine soul i'm\n03:06 - not the corruptable body i'm the divine soul say it about 10 times a day 20 times a day a thousand times a day the hindi people okay it says i am not this\n03:30 - i'm not this body mind i am divine consciousness so when you say i'm divine consciousness and be still then you are living the life divine\n03:39 - you're letting the divine consciousness permeate and how do you test what is the litmus test for divine consciousness it is contentless\n03:49 - when you have a contentless consciousness not a thought in your consciousness it's bereft of the thought that type you are living the life divine\n03:59 - that means in a temporary state of paravasta you say we teach you parabasta in kriya how many people know of the word paravastha kriya yogis who know the word\n04:09 - raise your hands right up yeah those who don't bend the elbows i can give them a special blessing without bent elbow can you do it like\n04:19 - this like me without bending your elbow yes because i can see okay so this this is what means living the\n04:30 - life divine even when you're doing kriya suddenly your mind wanders mentally is pull yourself back i am the lightening you divine i am divinity i am the lightning youth divine\n04:44 - i am the lightning you divine lightning your divine is babaji when you do the kriya every time you are reminding yourself of your divine origin when you remind yourself again and again\n04:57 - you are you are inserting discriminative wisdom the wisdom is that you are not a perishable body but a divine soul this is one of the greatest\n05:08 - factors which are an obstacle to your divinity is thinking that you are a perishable body and not a divine soul you are a divine soul and have a perishable body\n05:20 - you are not a perishable body and have a divine soul you are the divine soul and have a perishable body which can be cast away and another body can be taken\n05:29 - an old body can be cast away and a new body can be taken is that clear so keep reminding yourself i'm not no perishable body am i i'm divinity itself\n05:50 - i am divine consciousness i am not the perishable body i am divine consciousness i am not the perishable body i am divine consciousness\n06:02 - close your eyes close your eyes move your little move the speck of your perishable body from left to right move close your eyes\n06:16 - identify with the vast consciousness behind you identify with the vast consciousness behind you behind this little body speck of yours\n06:31 - the infinite ocean of divinity rose identify with the infinite ocean of divinity which is the background of your little speck\n06:40 - behind the body speck and move your body speck move your not self from left to right gently close your eyes\n06:49 - move your not self from left to right identify with your true self which is the vast ocean of divinity behind you [Music] now\n07:07 - keep your body still identify with the vast ocean of divinity behind you um [Music]\n07:24 - and move the not self from left to right this is your vehicle it's just a little blob of you you are the ocean this is the drop\n07:35 - of the not self but the ocean of divinity is behind you and the ocean of a spot of divinity is within your soul and in between that\n07:51 - is the congealed not-self the physical body and the mind but\n08:01 - within the physical body and the mind is the essence of your soul the spirit is the essence of the spirit and outside of your body is the infinite ocean of spirit\n08:14 - so this inner spirit the drop must merge into the ocean but for the drop of to get to the ocean it must practice kriya yoga and such techniques to thin\n08:28 - to make tennis the body and the mind you put the hands of your mind upon the eyes of your soul which is inside is the spirit\n08:43 - you put the hands of your mind upon the eyes of your soul and cry that you cannot see take away the hands of your mind by kriya yoga\n08:56 - merge the drop into the ocean spirit and there it is you are enlightened identify behind this body speck of yours the\n09:17 - infinite ocean of divinity rose identify yourself with the infinite ocean of divinity your body is a speck of non-being who is identifying\n09:31 - the spirit in your body is that individual spirit in your soul is identifying with the universal spirit outside your body and mind so the individual spirit of the soul\n09:46 - is merging into the infinite ocean of divinity that is the purpose of yoke evolving to merge the jiva drop into the shiva\n09:56 - ocean jiva shivachi is readily samadhi the drop merges into the ocean and i am enlightened but the body and mind\n10:08 - the various stratas of mind are an obstacle and for this we practice the science of kriya yoga the inner selves endeavour\n10:23 - to merge into the universal self this endeavor is called yoga the effort to unity of the jiva with shiva\n10:37 - of the water with the ocean of the self with the super self of the atma with paramatma be still i am there for you as the presence\n11:27 - take the assistance do not be shy to take the assistance of the satguru if you see his form and face your thoughts will disappear those are the barriers\n11:39 - that come between your individual consciousness and the super consciousness this is living a life of divinity i'm not the perishable body i'm the\n11:56 - divine soul o sadhguru you are the divine soul take me to the infinite\n12:11 - divinity you will see that you will have no thoughts now since guru nanak is serving you as a larger yourself\n12:26 - is giving you the food and not the venue this tranquility of mind which you experience is an introduction of guru natal of\n12:37 - sadhgurunath this is my identity i am there for you as the spirit of nothingness i am there for you as the presence babaji\n13:39 - then stiller than stillness itself with baited breath i do behold my rising self sons nectar gold\n13:55 - then stiller than stillness itself with baited breath i do behold my rising\n14:11 - self sons nectar gold i dissolve in that mystery untold\n14:30 - this is a state of nirvichar samadhi be still and know that you are god no body movement no mind thoughts tranquility\n15:29 - at its best your consciousness is raised above your body your emotions and your mind i am now taking you to this the ultimate\n15:48 - healing is enlightenment and in the state of paravasta you are still with the satguru\n15:59 - you are still with mahadeva pure stillness is mahadeva integrated consciousness is mahadeva shiva bereft of thought\n16:25 - just the stillness i take you to the land of the stillness and the peace you often craved the land of the hamsas\n18:16 - and deeper and deeper you go into the heightened awareness of your own divinity the more silent you become the purer\n18:26 - the spirit of your soul is the purity of divinity knows no bounds purify your spirit self by regular practice\n18:45 - by thinning out the mind attenuating the mind for you are the spirit of the lord i am spirit i am truth i am love divine this body mind a dream of mine\n19:10 - this is the mantra i give to all people in america the vivek kyati chant this while going to bed every time and rising up i am spirit i am truth i\n19:20 -

          "transcript": "00:00 - oh the only purpose of man sergeant on this earth is to seek God Oh Jim let's get back to the sweet old Jim here who has a Jim who has the Jim that's great\n00:50 - and what about your Jim in your life Wow let us get it back to the colonel and it is a very intelligent don't underestimate the ladies you cannot get part they're so smart and so wise that\n01:32 - for you and our men are sitting dumb so I don't think we should answer the question because we've already clapped for them is that enough for young girls they are very satisfied they have\n01:47 - satisfied girls and say yes : ah that's enough okay let's let us ask then let us get it to the the the smaller one is the macroscopic and one is a microscopic one but both are dyed see months so the G\n02:05 - what is this that a when you go to the gym when you work out you working out yeah you know preserving your muscle mass getting healthy lands circulation basic of Germans the gym is\n02:20 - why do people go to circulation for the simulation good a simulation good elimination so good health depends upon circulation a simulation and elimination you circulate with a society be an equal\n02:37 - to circulation you get a good circulation and you feel hungry but you get a good with digestion you get it you've digested food where digested where there's good elimination\n02:48 - circulation of simulation elimination this is but as you keep it and you grow older and older you along side you are doing a Kriya yoga which lengthens your breath right you're serving this amount\n03:01 - of gym but you do it's very very negligible you know it's like you say when I go and I do Surya you this is that speeding up the bread right but that harmony yeah minute is diluent five\n03:25 - minutes three minutes the bus written ten minutes half an hour one two hours okay but you're one aggressive Korea 1/2 a minute cycle of Korea is equal to one year of natural spiritual unfoldment\n03:43 - so that is way way beyond what you do you're faster aerobic breathing in the gym don't worry go ahead because this is a million times more it's one year and\n03:55 - half a minute cycle of a breath and that you're doing only for half an hour one or not yeah one breath is one year so nothing to worry about of that because the diet factors and durations are a lot\n04:07 - even I had this this is a good question so the moment you go back start breathing fast ok whatever but I wanna kriya will keep you ahead by one year so you'd be many thousands of years ahead\n04:25 - now we get to the next position we're into the law of karma this word our sages did perceive this world they also knew is subject to equilibrium forces this world of sages did perceive a\n04:47 - subject to equilibrium forces this world and balance cannot be without its gains or losses so the moment you enter duality karma begins suppose you had a state a thought free state of awareness\n05:13 - which I will take you there is no Karma they're speaking individually the moment you come into your tin ticking mind what mind tin ticking tick-tock tick-tock tick-tock it's a molecule action\n05:32 - molecular means to and fro karma begins karma begins with the first thought karma begins with desire okay the scene of desire is latent in every human being because from the seed of desire creation\n05:51 - is born from the great calm okay so now this in the individual scale in your individual scale as less long as you are with Gurunath in a state of in in a thought free state of awareness in a\n06:11 - thought free state of knowingness you are not creating karma because you are thought free you are pure so you cannot create karma you are good in the nothingness good in nothingness good for\n06:33 - nothing state creates no karma is that clear the moment you come down moment you come down and you say namah shivay Oh namah Shivaya namah Shivaya namah shivay you are creating karma maybe that\n07:05 - karma will literally do to liberation no doubt but you are creating sattvic karma Satoru guna karma you are creating electronic karma then after that state\n07:33 - if you if you if you do the job then you are creating the first karma in the mind [Music] namashivaya [Music]\n07:49 - namashivaya it's in the buddhic body on the mental body then you want to create your getting down more and more into relativity into matter namah shivay Shiva you know fever you\n08:17 - know so from the mental Carm of the mental body your emotional bodies come into play now now you're doing emotional karma why because from the nama sure from head you have gone to heart so when\n08:32 - you go to heart your emotional body comes into play you understand so the first karma and the buddhic body starts with ohm then the ohm namah shivaya and the mental body then singing\n08:46 - the O namah shivay in the emotional body and then you go namah Shivaya om namah shivay amna then you're creating in the physical body so that's how karma is created from the first seed of desire\n09:02 - the desire to think of God the desire to emote God the desire to dance God so mental desire emotional desire physical desire all creates karma but since it is God's Karma it is called sattvic Karma\n09:27 - okay then how is the rajasic karma created the rajasic prota electro protonic rajasic karma thank you oh i'm meditating now meditating there's no\n09:48 - thought than the first thought comes it would be nice I'm feeling hungry so I must have a nice chicken curry no I I must just eat then in the mental state I must have chicken curry with with\n10:10 - little bottle of wine so that that is in the mental state then the thought the most mental karma the emotional Karma cause your mouth starts watering so that's being emotional right you're\n10:26 - being very emotional about the food because your senses sensually emotional that's emotional karma then you you get up and said enough sit in your car bro drive away\n10:39 - give me a chicken curry and a bottle of red merlot wine it's right that's your physical Karma physical Karma in the rajasic I'm sick also it's raw someone murdering someone you think of it you\n10:54 - get angry and emotional about it you pick it up and you go and stab the fellow that is Tomczyk karma so I'm just dividing the Karman see how they are born karma is born like this Karma's the\n11:06 - creation of one's own desires when you do use your SATs at Vivek Buddha you create good karma when you don't use it and go blind do you create bad karma right so karma begins from the first\n11:21 - thought of desire but what I am giving you an experience where you will be ending your karma as long as you are in the space-time continuum the law of action and reaction\n11:38 - will work on you whether it be at the mental level emotional level or physical level but when you have no thought you transcend the space-time continuum and you are in a stillness inner awakening\n11:56 - this the stillness the inner awakening the inner knowingness when you are a thought free state of awareness then you are in a state of a karma not doing any karma so the moment you come into\n12:11 - duality from singularity you come into duality you create karma right from the nomina you come into the phenomena you create karma from the singularity to duality you create Karma and from the\n12:32 - reality you come into the relativity you create karma so all that is in relativity you know the general theory of relativity this every action has an equal and opposite reaction everything\n12:45 - is related to something else right as long as you are in the world of relativity you create Karma the moment you enter from the state of no-mind into mind the first desire you create karma\n12:58 - have I explained myself clearly yes yes because you have to lead your normal daily life now but say about of millions of years you become like that Archangel Gabriel or Michael then you\n13:15 - will not be living this life right attention Michael does not do what you do he has different life now so that life is living the light so when you evolve\n13:27 - to that state you will be in that state now you are in this state but you are trying to go to that state so your gurus giving you a little bit of that state and then you come back then little bit\n13:39 - of that state come back then more of that state come back after hundred million years always in that state of God happy you won't remain as you are right of\n14:02 - course which God are you talking about you have the Creator he about whom not may be said he about whom we know nothing and even the one we know about nothing knows nothing so the further\n14:24 - that one is the middle one that's God the Creator yes it is the desire the Creator that's why it's called the Creator and what that what desire did the Creator have to create creation\n14:46 - right right that's why he's called the Creator right so what are you telling me what is new creator is meant to create right preservers is meant to preserve if you see the Creator dissolving before\n15:09 - his time dissolving creation then they say hey god you're going wrong something's wrong your job is to create your second aspect is to preserve and the final aspect is\n15:21 - to dissolve and redeem the soul so these are the three phases of God so if God has a desire what you are trying to say that he is imperfect right right yeah but you are shy to say it because\n15:40 - the show God she's the same God is imperfect how dare she say that so she's right God is imperfect in his lowest form because out of the imperfect concatenation of forces action and\n15:55 - reaction life and death light and dark joy and sorrow that happens from imperfection and that imperfection which happens of the desire of God to create is called Karma because\n16:08 - the evolving soul Brahma also evolves has to evolve to the state of finality right he is 13.7 billion years ago old hmm and for him to live out his whole lifespan\n16:23 - he has to live 311 trillion years right and you're going around waving your Mayan calendar 5,000 years and saying the Indians - the Mayans thought the Indians what time is Indians never\n16:42 - bothered about time they said oh Lord we want to live in timelessness the timeless wisdom so that is right is that clear",

          "transcript": "00:02 - the only purpose of man's sergeant on this earth is to seek god because thoughts are the ones that are the that are killing that's the\n00:15 - pollution of the mind the gaddankin thoughts are called gaddankin in in german so you have to kick them out with the words unnecessary\n00:29 - thought that's training your mind this is this is what you called if you can't train your thoughts you're not an educated person you're an educated person if your\n00:39 - thoughts obey you so there are very few educated people they are known as satgurus and no because i'm literally taking the word educate\n00:50 - educate means to bring in the light and the satguru has brought in the light in his being therefore he is called enlightened and\n00:59 - therefore he is educated educated and therefore not only can he bring in the light in his life but transform that light into your life\n01:09 - this is how far we have wandered from true education i marvel at this dichotomy of this whole human error you know and life is a comedy of errors\n01:24 - and we live it as we like it that's what america wants we don't want this this is my body do it on the road do this\n01:34 - hey hey wait a minute wait a minute you've got to discipline yourself first a banjo cannot play every string of the banjo the guitar says hey i'm free let\n01:47 - me go one wire is going this way one wire says i want to stand on my head now the other says i want to kneel the other says i want to run dance a jig\n01:55 - no then the guitar or the banjo will not perform the act for which it was made it was made to play the tune of the guitar but if every\n02:11 - string of the guitar is indisciplined how will it achieve its purpose in life this is my mind i'm not popping from karl marx or from communism or from democracy\n02:23 - or from dictatorship this is guru nanak i'm a founding father and i have to guide you you have to be disciplined and those who are not disciplined will\n02:34 - wither away and be their life will be wasted so so that it is not wasted i am putting my life on the line to see that you are a finely tuned\n02:48 - flute so that when the breath of god blows through you you play the music of the spheres and charm god and compel him to hug you\n03:04 - it's not your body it's my body i'll do it with myself these young girls and although my grandchildren already begin talking like this or all\n03:13 - you know they're very young children but they show that this old man doesn't know anything it's my body i'm going to paint my nails as i like i'm going to do as i like\n03:22 - all mothers have gone through this all but me as a grandfather i didn't face my grandchildren and i felt that their totally new dimension i don't force them so i told them i told\n03:33 - my grandchildren i said my dears you are not it is not your body can you stop your pulse that's your no no ajuba can you stop the blinking of your eyes\n03:45 - no can you stop your heartbeat no then my dear how is it your body your ego is saying it is your body your ego is saying it's your body i know that the\n03:59 - women or the young ladies in america have said this word in relation to their bodies to having children to abortions i don't want to get into that they\n04:08 - should be allowed to abort whenever they want they should be allowed to have a child whenever they want but it's all superfluous\n04:13 - stuff as only a yogi can say that this is my body can you control your breath guru not yes sir not only can i control my breath but i can breathe\n04:27 - through your breath as well so this is not my body but your body is also my body because you cannot control your thought and mind how is it your mind\n04:40 - guru not is it your mind it is my mind and your mind is also my no mind all of you have experienced that right so now we cannot refute these these\n04:53 - propositions which are put because you have experienced these propositions your thought goes into a blank as a matter of fact effortlessly if i'm sitting near you you're already calm\n05:04 - the moment you look at me you're gone you're meant to disappear because that's the disappearance of the ego so this is to be understood that a certain amount of discipline\n05:16 - is required because ravishankar plays the sitar and the sitar plays heaven it's dancing and the world is entranced but if the sitar like the human being\n05:29 - she must be fine tuned to its work not too tight and not too loose if it's too tight the strings will break don't go over fasting and doing that if it's too loose\n05:43 - it won't produce the music it is meant to produce [Music] so it must be just correctly fine tuned like buddha said take the middle path\n05:53 - not to austere not to slack but a flexible discipline is required in the practice of yoga remember this a flexible discipline is required and therefore when you are\n06:06 - fine-tuned to nature's flow mind melts into the opal glow and that's what you want that's a heavenly mind you can't have a mind which you can't\n06:17 - control in this thing you've got your degrees from outside but you may miss the main purpose you know you filled the knowledge you got your degree\n06:28 - but you have a leaking vessel as a leaking vessel never can fill the waters of life so pure and still so distracted mind\n06:39 - fails to retain wisdoms nectar in its brain what's the use of having a leaking mind and have done your phd it's no use\n06:49 - the very instrument of mind must be changed the minds not the system but the the minds of the people who run the system must be changed\n06:59 - then there can be a change and i am not influenced by anybody or anyone yes that's the minds of the people when charges need to be changed they need to be able to control their\n07:12 - own minds just say it louder the minds of the people in charge need to be changed yes they need to change their\n07:20 - own minds yes and be able to control their own thoughts yes not the system system cannot do anything you get a system or other rotten minds\n07:29 - it will repeat the same thing so what i'm doing is the real education that you carry and the real work and therefore it is your bounding duty the next time you\n07:38 - come bring at least 10 people with you to convince them that look we are off track true education before you die you have to be educated you just bring in the light\n07:49 - be ushered into light not die sitting on your pot which many people can't help they just pass off bad karma but you can change your karma\n08:01 - and this is the most important thing that you can do in life is to be self-realized educary bring in the light bring in the light and that's what i've\n08:10 - said in my book the yoga sutras of patanjali which i will be signing and giving to you all it is it is one of the good works of mine\n08:21 - where i've just deferred with patanjali himself so for reasons rightly so so you can judge for yourself a person who does differ with patanjali\n08:32 - must be having some standing of his own and must have met him in some time of his life do you understand i'm just dropping a few hints\n08:41 - but we have to give him his respect also so he's a great sage but you have to cut it to the core guys cut it to the core without discipline\n08:54 - nothing can happen our school master jim teacher was a rough and tough guy he was quite a mr ford of an australian fellow and all and at sunday evening chapel\n09:08 - all the boys who in the gym with him training for boxing and weights and all used to see they were looking at all the girls passing for sunday evening church so the it was not boys didn't go to\n09:20 - church to pray to god they went to church to look at the girls because how can you blame us we have never seen god but we've seen girls\n09:30 - so at the age of from the age of 5 to 15 what does a guy know you see a beautiful girl with golden hair and she's goddess finished so the the mr fordham used to tell us the school\n09:44 - hey guys remember all you guys i'm gonna whack you hard you boys bloody rascals straight is the line of duty curved is the line of beauty follow the\n09:55 - straight line and you will see that the curved line will ever follow thee so he said sir this is but will the curved line follow us because if you go on the straight line\n10:03 - and the curved line doesn't come then we think of great concern they used to teach us all these things and though you come out of each grueling bout\n10:14 - just have one more try the what does it say and though you come all beaten and broken in and though you come out of each grueling\n10:23 - bout all beaten and broken and scarred just have one more try it's dead easy to die it's the keeping on living that's hard and they used to tell us even if you're\n10:33 - tired keep running keep running and that's what made us in the marathons we were tired there's no we had to run about a 10 mile marathon 10 to 11 miles\n10:42 - and our guys used to encourage us when i went to the bottom of the lake mr johnson says have one more try i said sir i'm totally exhausted and i can't see a thing give me a torch\n10:53 - at the bottom then there was one hand looming and they gave me a certificate of courage for repeatedly descending to the bottom of\n11:00 - the lake and saying but i knew how afraid i was and i knew that mr johnson gave me that courage to again repeat it and face that deadly it was like death\n11:11 - 40 feet in a deep lake is it's about about twice or thrice this house this thing and your drums go to a bursting so they teach us these things in school\n11:24 - for which we are very grateful it makes the man spare the rod and spoil the child and now here the mothers are going and saying oh my little\n11:33 - johnny and he's got a running nose and this thing so the whole thing is becoming so i told the school i said sir at our time we used to be ready waiting\n11:43 - out in the cold ready to be whacked waiting for the cane and outside the principal's office here the mothers are complaining and they made at that time\n11:52 - we produced 25 to 30 lieutenant generals of our country and we produced one field marshal and six air chief marshals because of the discipline\n12:08 - so discipline i'm saying these are you guys are already disciplined otherwise you wouldn't be here with me discipline is a very very important thing you can lose it i lays i come\n12:17 - think but for your sadhana and for god never never spare never spare yourself just go the extra mile\n12:25 - the extra mile",

          "transcript": "00:04 - now as you all know that I have not come here to give you a lecture or a talk I've come here to know you and I am open to know you and you must in turn know\n00:25 - me and this whole occasion let's jump out of the box this not about lectures or talk this is about celebrating life we are all here about celebrating\n00:43 - life I celebrate life it's not about walk or lecture or talk or yoga or philosophy or Christianity or Humanity or it's about celebrating life everything comes in\n00:58 - that and because of a lack of words in English I had to create a new word it is about celebrating soulfulness so today I'm going to give you a celebration of soulfulness not\n01:15 - only will I have to have the painful task of explaining to you soulfulness but I must give you a taste of soulfulness this is important I must give you a t I must give you a taste of\n01:27 - soulfulness right so therefore the first half of my talk and my interaction with you would be to interact AAS I'd like to interact with\n01:39 - your aura you know there's there's nothing is done unless the ice is broken at the the the people here they so intellectual so mindful there there's a new system of uh yogic training which\n01:55 - they were not able to explain which they practicing it's called mindfulness so I completed the Poetry the poem by saying mindfulness\n02:06 - soulfulness and Consciousness I will explain to you what all three are then I will give you an experience the experience will be a transitory experience you will be\n02:20 - transiting from mindfulness to soulfulness to Consciousness I can you hear me and I'd also like you to talk talk in between with me and interact and\n02:33 - respond let's be something different than the painted walls let's react and respond and of course after that I'm going to give you an\n02:44 - opportunity uh to ask questions and clear your doubts all the celebration of life and celebration of\n02:57 - soulfulness is to get you to the state of practicing yog through the new life Awakening Movement we have this new life Awakening movement to celebrate\n03:12 - soulfulness and to form communities thereby to form Gatherings whereby we can generate enough of Soulful love to shatter the hatred with the love\n03:26 - we generate this is what we got to do this is the job don't worry about the pain in your foot because the world disciple is not a perfected World\n03:37 - disciple we have a world disciple the world disciple is a cosmic man semi Cosmic man who has 7.6 billion cells in its body which means the souls on this planet Earth and\n03:54 - the world disciple is collective humanity is the world disciple have you understood I so some portions of this Collective Humanity have got ganger some have got a\n04:05 - broken leg some have got emotional suffering leave it don't dwell on the ganger or the emotional suffering dear Souls dwell on the light dwell on celebrating\n04:20 - soulfulness dwell on celebrating livingness this is what I'm here for and to wake you and Shake you up a little if I just talk I'll keep keep you bored like I'm seeing all your faces are\n04:33 - pretty serious and glum I my Endeavors to make make the faces smile and genuinely not from outwardly to show me but from the soul within from practicing soulfulness let me explain to you this\n04:48 - I've seen some people they're throwing words around which is good which we I explaining what yog is in modern terminology I went to London I had some seminars and some sessions\n05:03 - there and I found that this word mindfulness was very popular there and I asked a few people what it means but they could not tell me so I said I may as well create\n05:15 - my own meaning and may as well understand it in the sense of yog since it is it is plucked out from the ancient background of yog the unity Humanity Community\n05:29 - Humanity mindfulness is a very profound State of Mind the first state of mind if we start from\n05:51 - concentration the practice of concentration would be as you focus on a particular object or a person your thoughts keep running away from the focus the object of your\n06:08 - focus before you can wrap your mind around that particular object or person there are 10 other thoughts which come and distract that concentration I to repeatedly bring back the Stray\n06:22 - thoughts to the focus of your attention to the object of your attention is called the practice of concentration I'm thinking let's say there's this picture of this person this gurunath\n06:38 - he's there by the United Nations and it's a beautiful picture I'm seeing the globe there and there he's standing there in the same old clothes which he's wearing now and it's a very nice picture\n06:52 - and then suddenly somebody with a orange shirt comes I get distracted he's he's going to the corner and I don't know what he's doing there's another lady they've come this a distracted so I\n07:01 - bring my distracted thought again I say okay let's get back to the man with a beard and he's got a wonderful beard and he's standing before the UN symbol I wonder did he speak the same subject at\n07:11 - the United Nations or not and this thing and then some some ladies going with a bag again opening the door so get I pull the thought back again I focus on the object so this is a distracted mind and\n07:26 - I'm concentrating I'm trying to cultivate the faculty faulty of exclusive attention upon that person the picture of that person as long as this pulling these\n07:39 - stray thoughts the Vagabond thoughts as long as I keep them pulling back I'm known to practice concentration the moment concentration is perfected and there's no distraction\n07:49 - no thoughts distracting and there's a constant flow there's an effortless flow towards the object which is the picture of gurunath uninterrupted Ed by any other\n08:01 - thought or any other distraction that is a flow a train of thoughts flowing Only onto gurunath and then your mind is full only of gurunath that is a state of mindfulness have I explain this\n08:17 - mindfulness how many have heard of this new technique it's a fad it's come out mindfulness raise your hands oh oh my God it spread well viral and how how many explained it in this way did is how\n08:30 - many found this way a better a good explanation to that raise your hands and a new explanation to that raise your hands okay it's obviously a new explanation I\n08:41 - don't agree with you that you knew this so because because I'm creating this so constant when when a rower is rowing a boat firstly he is distracted he doesn't\n08:57 - get into Rhythm his body gets into rhythm his OES are clutched and then he gets into the same Rhythm and there's nothing but heave ho heave ho when he gets into that Rhythm he is only focused\n09:12 - on that Rhythm the O and he roing that with effort as long as there's effort in the rowing with The Boatman and the O that is called mindfulness that is called concentration\n09:25 - when the O and the roow become one the O and the person holding the O they become one life they come fused into one that is called mindfulness\n09:40 - right now there's another stage of soulfulness the mindfulness is when there is no distraction and is rowing but when the boat the O The Boatman the\n09:56 - boat and the O they become one and there no difference between them all are one he the subject and the object become one the both the O and the person rowing that is known as\n10:12 - soulfulness soulfulness is when you're so intent on the object that it becomes one mindfulness soulfulness in mindfulness you are focusing on the\n10:27 - image and when you're perfectly in mindfulness and there's no distraction but it's only regarding the picture of gurunath where does he come from who is he what did he talk at the United\n10:41 - Nations with no other hey get my coffee hey let's go to Trader Joe's and get some uh truffle uh what are those latest fads which you guys have truffle armonds who are the Truffle armonds many of you\n10:53 - have known that has spread very wild and it's very good if you haven't had have it so you get those distraction of truffle armonds when you don't get those distractions and you're totally at one\n11:02 - flow of thought one flow only regarding the guru that one flow of thought who is he where is he from what does he teach that is mindfulness you're not distracted\n11:14 - that is mindfulness a ceaseless flow of thought without outer distraction is mindfulness soulfulness is when he looks so much at the photo of gurunath that the subject the subject and the object\n11:28 - become one there's no thought then I am him I'm experiencing him that is soulfulness that's a very high state of composed mind are you understanding what I'm\n11:42 - saying okay very high state of composed mind I'm I'm I'm actually speaking about the the the psychology of mystical Awakening the psychology of Spiritual Awakening then you get to a higher state\n11:56 - of expansion which is known as consciousness when the Mind leaves the object of gurun Nat's photo and gurunath becoming one he leaves a\n12:09 - relative object he leaves relativity he leaves Duality and goes into the singularity which is not focusing on the attributes or the\n12:21 - physical body of the person nor the attributes of the person but just going into his awareness his consciousness and both fusing at a higher level which is Transcendence\n12:37 - so mindfulness informs soulfulness transforms you into one right and Consciousness is it is eminent and is\n12:51 - transcendent it is beyond the physical body Beyond Duality so when you go into Consciousness there is no thought but both the Souls of both the People Meet yeah the bodies meet in soulfulness or\n13:04 - the subtle body this intuitional body meets in soulfulness but the spiritual Soul becomes one in Consciousness so mindfulness soulfulness mindfulness soulfulness and\n13:18 - Consciousness in finite have I explained [Applause] this thank you for your appreciation these are the three things which we have to uh learn and\n13:33 - these are the three things which we learn while practicing Kundalini Kaa yog which is the later purpose of what I'm going to teach you I'm going to\n13:44 - initiate you into a simple practice it's easy anybody can do it it's easy it's meant for householders also the Kaa yog which I'm going to initiate you into tomorrow is a very simple method which\n13:59 - takes you through these expanded states of awareness and Consciousness is the Ecstasy of expanded awareness the Ecstasy of expanded\n14:15 - Consciousness that is consciousness so I will be taking you through these states very swiftly consecutively from mindfulness to soulfulness to consciousness\n14:30 - you may not notice it and land straight in Consciousness and experience but you must prepare yourself now and start dissolving the unnecessary thoughts in your mind from now because it's over an\n14:44 - hour hence I will be giving you this for this please listen to me feelingly not thinking just sit and relax and absorb for",

          "transcript": "00:08 - each one must take personal responsibility for his own welfare humanity is endowed with a very delicate nervous system brain structure an astral\n00:23 - system of chakras and the thousand-petaled lotus if he doesn't look after his delicate mechanism for the evolution of his own consciousness\n00:32 - then who will the god within you god has given a spark of is within you and that's pushing from within without it depends on the degree of your\n00:48 - motivation the inner push which will evolve you if you choose to stay and slumber in darkness then you shall but the main valiance the main courage of man is that even in\n01:02 - the darkness he wants to see the light and the light shineth in the darkness and the darkness comprehended it not the darkness can never comprehend the light\n01:14 - for the light is the dispeller of all darkness even a little bit of light can this dispel the darkness of ignorance what you are doing now is\n01:28 - we call this a true language in english language if you if you try to get down to the details of what you're doing it's called educare you're being educated\n01:38 - education because in greek educare means to bring in the light how do your modern schools and systems educate you\n01:50 - they're just informing you your computers are good your iphones are better i was very uh you know attracted to the iphone robert borden showed me his iphone\n02:02 - and he i said it's a great toy because it's so good you don't have to think you do it and it's there everything's on the screen there's no keyboard nothing nothing\n02:12 - but all the same these things in form they are information they are inventions but it's not education it's not bringing in the light you see you have to activate your own\n02:29 - iphone and you can only activate your own iphone by seeing the eye you have to eliminate the eye to see the eye\n02:41 - you must eliminate the eye to see the eye of the soul you must eliminate the eye of the ego so to see the eye you must eliminate the eye\n02:52 - and then your iphone will work your iphones will not work till the eye of the ego is a static and a way between your eye and eye but\n03:05 - you must know which eye to eliminate and which eye to keep what we are doing is we are keeping the wrong eye and therefore the true eye cannot be seen initially\n03:18 - it's very difficult to tell between a crystal and a diamond but as you get practiced with the trained eye you shall be able to tell the diamond from the glass\n03:27 - the crystal glass so you have to practice be the diamond cutter of the diamond of your soul the seeing of the spiritual eye\n03:42 - assumes prime importance in this time where you can be steady and contact your intuition get in touch with your conscience and do what is truly right for you\n04:02 - there are no relative things like bison virtue and good and bad and dark and light and high and low and personal ethics and global ethics the only thing that is before your eyes\n04:15 - don't complicate a simple thing by the spaghetti of your words and get stuck in the spaghetti of your words and land up with analysis paralysis you\n04:25 - can't do that you have to be simple your only object in this world is god and knowing god you will know everything all sufferings and the sufferings of\n04:36 - others will be eliminated do you think god does not know what's happening in this world it's all a screenplay on the screen of life\n04:47 - it's all a cosmic motion picture a play of light and shadows but we think that this light in shadows is true due to our minds being deluded we're mistaking the effect for the cause\n05:03 - we have to do the work given to us in this life and that is to seek god in this life in spite of all distractions the only purpose of man's surgeon on this earth\n05:12 - is to seek god period lecture over this is it long and short but then the mind is so fidgety and finicky and it's so intellectual\n05:29 - in its tapestry that it wants to tap this that and the other and have its finger in every pie the mind so let's give the mind some exercise\n05:43 - the mind is like the monkey you have to make him go up and down the pole of the spine till he gets exhausted by the practice of kriya yoga transform\n05:52 - all your thoughts into the flaming star that's the practice of kriya yoga bind your mind to god and nothing else but how is that practical of course it's the most practical thing\n06:05 - but it doesn't way it doesn't work according to our logic god has his own logic he has his open ways and he will make it work\n06:17 - and even if he doesn't make it work so what god i still love you this is the brave soul god if you love me i love you if you kick me i'll love you\n06:29 - if you spit on my face i love you i will love you whatever this is my decision and i made up my mind now you do what you want\n06:41 - and don't worry me and tempt me and helps me with these petty ferraris and these little toys am for god alone every breath belongs to him\n06:55 - and he is the one who tests you before putting you on the high seas he tests you with money with name with fame and ferraris\n07:08 - and whatever so you have to see through this and know that the only purpose the main purpose the core purpose of your life is to progress towards your\n07:25 - parent source and your here's your parent source you cannot help but go towards him yes\n07:37 - yesterday right before i was held on for a period of about 15 seconds in my field position because once i was in a in a company called baka wolf it's a german company\n08:00 - and uh i was getting used to meditating long as but when i went to this temporary java mine i didn't get that time to meditation so i went to the restroom and i felt\n08:12 - very peaceful then i just moved out of my body once i was trying very hard to meditate and get into that state outer body state\n08:21 - i couldn't get into that outer body state so it was raining a lot and that time we were just beginning it was about 30 to 40 years back the 30\n08:31 - years back i'd say we just started the yoga class in my class it used to leak so i used to close it in winter because we used to just take it in an old hall\n08:41 - in puna some of you have seen that place you come to my house it used to be a huge pool i didn't have the money and i was doing everything so i got\n08:49 - that day i've been set and i announced it's a class on thursday so i came with a bucket i came with an old towel and i was mopping it and doing this sitting on my arches like\n08:59 - this and you know doing this and suddenly i went right out of my body so when it at certain stages he gives it to you when you least\n09:11 - expect it he gives it to you when you least expect it and it's not this is the wealth this is what god wants you to have it all you see again\n09:22 - these people the basic thing is they're going into the objective sphere it is the western mind it goes outward the indian mind is always subjective it goes inwards\n09:34 - he wants you to have the inner jojo the inner experience if you have all the ferraris all the wealth in the world all the wine women and laughter in the\n09:44 - world and your mind is in a depression or in sorrow then you're in hell if you are in the material in heaven and your mind is a mess you're in hell\n09:57 - but if you're an actual hell and your mind is glorious dancing with the light and love of power of god and his glory then even in hell you're in heaven\n10:06 - so heaven and hell is not determined by the place heaven and hell is determined by your inner state of consciousness it's by a state of mind it's not the\n10:18 - action which is a sin it is the spirit in which it is done which makes it a vice or a virtue the action itself is not\n10:28 - a vice or a virtue it's the spirit in which it is done if i'm out of malice i shoot it i take a gun and shoot one person it's a sin because the spirit is malice\n10:41 - if i take the same gun turn around and fight for my country and shoot 100 people i get the order of the purple star congressional order of merit same gun\n10:49 - same man one is vice versa virtue what's this relativity of global ethic relativity of global ethics so one man's food is another poison\n11:02 - so the guy who's hailed as a as a great war hero in this country may be the devil in the other country so that's why this global ethics and personal ethics is a relative term\n11:18 - it can change it depends on on what your values are your values determine your ethics your soul essence determines your ethics you know your global ethics may be to\n11:32 - certain thing and direct contact with god my global ethics may be just to keep building hospitals for the sick and the poor and you cannot convince me\n11:44 - that you you're merging into god in samadhi is any way better than my building hospitals for poor children although as a matter of fact i know of course merging into god samadhi\n12:01 - i'm saying just you know collecting pebbles by the by by the river side little round pebbles by the narvata collecting them every day and with full\n12:11 - faith offering it at the feet of sri krishna this is my devotion there's nothing higher than that and nobody in the world can convince me\n12:19 - that it's better than that of feeding children every saturday that's my religion that's my prayer i don't want your samadhi i don't want\n12:28 - your yoga i don't want your high fat talk nor your high states just feeding children if a man is lada you cannot so these are\n12:40 - all relative terms in relativity there's no standardization of ethics you know what is the global ethic what is the\n12:51 - it's standardization difficult yes are there any questions anybody wants to ask yes um i've heard that uh yogis that practice\n13:02 - yoga uh takes like a long time about about 100 years to reverse the aging process so they're practicing something else called the kayak alpha or something like that\n13:13 - and to have to keep the body beyond so that the bao kicks in after a hundred years is this something that getting stronger who says this\n13:33 - so of course yeah you see firstly the people who started the kriya yoga and the body of mortality are a group of people called the not yogis i belong to the north\n13:45 - tradition there's a great misunderstanding the body is the not self the soul is the self the spiritual soul is the self\n14:03 - so why are you giving so much importance to body immortality over your own divinity first comes god then comes body immortality\n14:15 - so if you seek god in this life there's no need to make your body immortal the body of mortality comes by his grace his blessings and his behest if he commands that thou shalt be\n14:27 - immortal that should be your attitude this is this is the spiritual philosophy on which we stand we don't give body immortality priority over god like leonardo did\n14:41 - leonardo came and started the process of rebirthing and if he reversed the process he thought i had it i also had a talk like i had to talk\n14:50 - with yogi bhajan i met hida khan baba era khan baba is a great soul and better more on more than one occasion and i told him i said look the you have\n15:03 - given this pranayama to the american people they have somehow altered it kept the idea of the yogic pranam\n15:12 - and they're using it for the primal scream and rebirthing they are retrograding reversing to the womb experience of the psychology\n15:24 - so then again he said you're there you go and correct it so i said this is fine this may be my work and so for many years i was correcting\n15:34 - the people who got stuck in their unfilming going back to their negative subconscious mind to the womb experience which they were\n15:43 - to have at the time of birth why do you have to go back i said don't go back put on the light the darkness will go you have to progress forward to the\n15:52 - birth year the second coming of the christ is here not here here the immaculate conception is here this is important so you have to the birth of the baby krishna is in the\n16:07 - third eye so you are born anew into the spiritual dimension of the christ consciousness and the christians this was very difficult to\n16:21 - explain you",

          "title": "Must I Be a Vegan to Be Enlightened?",
          "transcript": "00:02 - the only purpose of man's sergeant on this earth is to seek god my question is about um what's the difference between\n00:25 - eating one blood animal um i'm concerned about it because um like i'm trying to wean myself away from flush and just become a vegetarian\n00:45 - um i was told that um you could eat fish because it was cold blooded but i feel that anything that breathes with a heartbeat\n01:01 - it's not life and therefore you're taking life yes so the question was you can eat something like fish seafood which is cold blooded\n01:11 - but anything that is hot blooded you shouldn't eat because it's a sin or a vice or a virtue or this that or the other let's get to something more basic let's\n01:20 - go to the root of it all first identify yourself and second go to the inner composition of the vegetable plant and the fish and the chicken\n01:52 - then we will get onto the top and solve your problem this itself will solve all the problems of vegetarianism and meat and all that if you think that you are a physical\n02:04 - body and not a soul then all your problems begin but if you think that you are a soul and not a body or flesh and you are the sword then all\n02:18 - your problems are solved if you are the spirit then you can commit no sin if you realize that you are spirit whether you have a chicken\n02:34 - or you have a fish do you have vegetables or you eat your telephone because basically they're all made of electrons protons and neutrons i i does anybody disagree with this\n02:56 - now the question of this mess which is happening in the west comes because they are identifying with their body don't eat this don't eat fish don't eat\n03:06 - beef don't eat that i don't advocate eating meat either i'm vegetarian but let me tell you one thing whatever you do\n03:15 - don't step on the grass it's a live phenomena and don't eat vegetables whatever you do and never eat fruits because\n03:26 - the great indian scientist jagdish chandra bosh has discovered that fruits not only have a nervous system they have emotions too every time you\n03:39 - bite an apple it's going to say ouch don't hurt me because an apple is a life phenomenon is an apple dead or alive so is it more of a sin to eat an alive\n03:56 - apple or a dead chicken [Laughter] [Applause] but let me tell you when i talk in the\n04:16 - end i will still tell you be vegetarian be predominantly vegetarian and i tell you why but you are being it for the wrong reasons that's why i'm going on this little talk\n04:27 - with you i'm taking you for a walk in the woods well i want to know because i don't want anything to prohibit my meditation i'm letting you know i'm letting you\n04:36 - know it's a good thing you're on the right track so when you pluck a cabbage the cabbage cannot defend itself it's in\n04:47 - the earth and you pluck it and you boil it and cook it and eat it full of cabbage cabbage is not dead it's growing it's\n04:57 - alive the trees the plants the vegetables what are you doing what the hell are you doing get off the grass get off the goddawn\n05:13 - you're stepping on a live phenomena are you sitting under here you're killing millions of germs with your body shame on you [Laughter]\n05:29 - is it wrong that you're killing millions of germs when you breathe you're breathing elephants of germs in an electron microscope you see\n05:38 - what you breathe the huge pieces of flesh so you breathe them in and you dead them out you lift them in and die them out is that right or wrong\n05:50 - with every [Music] thousands of sperm go to the womb and only one of it makes it and forms the zygote\n06:10 - with the egg all the others are murdered by the mother's system and they die so the mother gives birth to one life to one and\n06:21 - murders the rest he's a murderer do you agree or disagree this is a scientific fact i'm taking you for a walk in the woods\n06:34 - the scientific fact so what are you doing why do vegans have this arrogance holier than now superior than now i'm vegetarian you're just a chicken eater\n06:50 - so i've had this on youtube and all the vegans they said don't do this i said tell me why i said does it murder doesn't the mother murder and all of you\n07:03 - here you were the first in the race you won your first olympic medal life has been taken by the very mother who gives life\n07:31 - so what is this this is what is called maya the great delusion it was difficult to understand this is how the law of karma works but\n07:40 - not your socks you do not know it's very complex and oranges and apples and bananas oh my god oh my god you peel a banana in here\n07:54 - into the pan i said oh god holy ravioli you're killing me i can hear them and you're just chopped chocolate because if you look at the banana\n08:09 - in a microscopic scene and you'll see it growing every day rolls a raw banana becomes ripe why does a raw banana become ripe because it\n08:25 - grows okay so what should i do guru natal shall i die because you're telling me not to eat get off the grass don't taste cabbage don't\n08:51 - eat vegetable don't eat celery don't eat spinach shall i die and guru nad says die [Laughter] and guru says because your\n09:14 - so then what's the solution don't eat chicken don't eat meat don't eat pork don't eat bananas don't eat cabbages don't eat spinach and don't eat apple and neither oranges\n09:24 - what do we eat so if you then guru not says first get to a clear-cut understanding first decide whether you and all the things that you\n09:39 - eat are the spirit of god or are you the flesh of god are you the spirit of god or the flesh of the earth if you are the spirit of god\n09:49 - then it doesn't matter what you drink or eat because that which you eat is also the spirit of god and the flesh of the earth is just the\n09:58 - food change discovery discovery channel national geographic small fish swimming big fish come open mouth\n10:08 - small fish in [Laughter] so we don't cry for the water did anybody cry okay if the chicken is the spirit then you\n10:24 - eat the flesh you're not you cannot kill anyone it is said in the gita who are you identify yourself you're not this house of flesh and bone\n10:34 - which sleeps decays and dies you are immortal consciousness lord of the earth and flies so if the chicken is also that and the pig is also that and the apple is also that and the banana is\n10:43 - also there who's killing who immortal consciousness is always free it's the food chain of the flesh of matter of relativity\n10:54 - living upon relativity life lives on death death lives on life and so the change goes on life lives on death and death lives on\n11:04 - life if the wildebeest don't die light cannot happen to the crocodile of an iron right you see a lion killing a wildebeest\n11:13 - it's the most common thing you don't start crying the lion you tell the lion hey lion become vegetarian so once a christian missionary he\n11:31 - decided to go to india the land of hiddens and uneducated people they have no knowledge they went to teach them religion and philosophy\n11:42 - of what god is i speak to some of the priests in europe and america oh boy they stand dumb so he went and he said jesus said jesus said jesus\n12:02 - carry on and he said now i'm going to convert all these hiddens indians to christianity so as he walked he landed on one of the coasts of gujarat\n12:16 - and he came and while he was walking a lion came from jesus won't work here not for the lion he works for me give me peace of mind\n12:35 - and so he came closer and then came closer and then the lion came close and he came through and then the lion stopped and the priest\n12:45 - stopped one in front of the other i did not describe you the condition the biophysiological condition of the priest\n13:03 - and so then the lion did the impossible the lion came in front of the priest and he said i was haunted when he did what are you doing he said i'm free\n13:26 - because i'm an educated liar you say first [Laughter] [Music]\n14:03 - the priest was very impressed so and then after that the lion said i find polish i'm educated i say grace i pray but now i'm going to eat you because i'm alive\n14:23 - education is super clueless the genuine lion is true at the bottom and so the lion ate the priest [Laughter]\n14:37 - [Applause] so what does the story tell us no matter how much of prayer and hypocrisy and polish we try to put we are basically what we are let us\n14:50 - accept what we are we have fruits we have grapes we have a little bit of fish we have a little bit of omelets scrambled eggs and i love it\n15:01 - and we like cheese you like cheese yeah you know you know cheese [Music] and the animal right one drop of milk\n15:29 - requires nine drops of blood to make it so you're a blood sucker say your let's not be holy and let's not be pious and let's not be wicked let's be normal\n15:45 - and let's learn the hard facts of life and accept accept things as they are and not go for holiness or wickedness let's go for the supreme\n15:54 - reality we want the reality we want the reality that which is true that which is so we have to pass through this maze\n16:05 - so now if you are identifying yourself as a physical a physical body and a person then you run into many complications and confusion of the mind should i take fish should i take the\n16:20 - cold blooded fish should i take chicken should i take a pork so these things really don't matter in the real scenario in the real picture\n16:32 - what matters that you have to get to god and you are the soul and so is the fish when you eat the fish it cannot dive the big fish eats you you cannot die because you're not the physical body\n16:44 - that's just the food chain i now i tell you be purely vegetarian as far as you can help it you cannot be vegetarian because while\n16:57 - you're praying you're still eating the germs and you're living your life a lot but say god as far as i can help it i am humble enough in your eyes i'm not arrogant like the\n17:11 - vegans they're very arrogant they're simple i'm humbled let me be vegetarian not that it makes a difference to you lord but because with a lighter diet\n17:22 - with a with the less heavy and a subtler diet i can get better concentration a better meditation i it's less it's light on the digestion and i feel healthier i feel good\n17:36 - and i know that the apple has life but the life is not that when i eat the apple it's just the flesh of the apple that i eat or if i if i have a\n17:51 - chicken or a once in a while a turkey or fish it's fine because nobody kills anyone this is just the food chain i am the soul the fish has a soul all of\n18:01 - this they are free and the food chain carries on otherwise you cannot continue so this is this is the answer to the whole thing that you must\n18:11 - realize that you're a soul the next reason why then there was a shift in the consciousness of the vegans another vegetarian the cruelty to animals\n18:26 - now this is a totally different issue veganism doesn't start with this it started with the pious thing that i am vegetarian their point then when they got this answer they said\n18:36 - we do it for a revolt against cruelty to animals was a cover-up as an afterthought now if there's a cruelty to animals prevent the cruelty to animals\n18:49 - and it's a way of protesting for against the cruelty to animals that we become vegetarian or we become vegan that i can understand but that is going to carry on in the\n19:04 - world because the animals like human beings have their karma the human being is an endangered species and it is the most\n19:17 - disgracefully treated it's ripped open from its behind right to its throat and left like a rotten gunny sack lying in the snows and lying in the deserts to rot\n19:30 - there is no compensation there is no sympathy no pity for the human being he's shocked by the hundreds yet if you shoot a siberian tiger or the royal bengal tiger\n19:40 - there's a file and almost a life imprisonment for 20 years jail if one of us guys get shot there won't be five minutes jail also nobody there's no jail not fine for a human\n19:51 - being shot right so the human being is the most disgraced animal on this earth and also the most glorified animal\n20:01 - he is the most endangered species and also the most prolific species as is multiplying at a very fast rate good",

he is confident his pardon [Music] [Music] [Music] this is so exclusive attention bringing\n32:59 - those ironic thoughts ran away gives back to the focus of the object is for the practice of concentration so when you keep practicing this concentration keep practicing this\n33:16 - and the thoughts moving over us Stephanie my object of Shiva is in mind the immediate form of Shiva fills your mind the only one thought that abusive\n33:31 - attention to Shiva this is - and becomes the object this is part of the process of mindfulness then you go deeper and deeper into focus of Shiro\n33:56 -

          "transcript": "00:02 - the only purpose of man's seran on this Earth is to seek God yes I have two questions that so I went\n00:17 - back also could not sleep like this gentleman and um and I just laid there and I I have this so the question is this do you do like this astral anesthetic verse before you start\n00:31 - because there was this extraordinarily Lush anesthesia type quality and the monra that we were singing last night was like just coiling through all of it and I kept singing it and then like\n00:45 - finally you came in at 4:15 and it was very clearly you and then you touched my third eye and there was a lavender spark and then I went deep into the CLE and it was gone but it seemed to me that it was\n00:56 - like like you had anesthetized the entire like astral Realms yeah I I call that lulls me to ecstasy Rosy rest I call it the rosy rest that's a spiritual Euphoria so you get into that that's a\n01:13 - state of samadi and that's that even up to right up to Anand the samadi because when you get to Anand samadi all forms and dreams disappear after that and only the attribute so\n01:25 - that's what you had experienced so I taken you to that state these are rare gifts these are rare gifts not to be gotten anywhere in the United\n01:35 - States right so you should have a very good opinion about your holy selves so enough if we have if if if coming back or if we have a dream that\n01:54 - includes like a few other humps is that relevant or is it just includes a few other hum say like like I just had one dream memory at all and it was Tiny but there were other there were a couple\n02:08 - other hses in it with you and I'm just wondering is that relevant or is it first everything is relevant everything is relevant from your sitting in the Hall putting your hands up talking to me\n02:18 - till the Dream Weaver till you're going into the nothingness and me everything is relevant in the AA Oceanic AA of the sguru the master everything is relevant right\n02:35 - yes I I had both dream and a deep sleep kind of a feeling and it was very clear that it was not subtle it was something like you somebody's doing a surgery on me and it was also clear that you are\n02:50 - doing the surgery this was like a message I was getting and then you asked two people to help you out on the surgery and there is a young boy and a young girl you asked them to hold me\n03:00 - when you're doing it and suddenly what happened that young girl uh fell apart and she was shivering and she was shaking and there was some wise I think your voice telling her just relax it'll\n03:12 - be okay little later so much thing I taken out so it it you're shivering only because of that you said that and then it slowly transition into a DPL so this is the clear dream part I remember but\n03:24 - the rest everything I totally slept full yeah so that is very good that means you worked at the astral and C levels the astral surgery which I did was preventing me from going to a more\n03:36 - important causal work I have to do with you so this necessitated the astral dream the surgery this necessitated that do you see that so in each one according to various ways according to their\n03:50 - individual needs not wants for their spiritual progress now before the next question you are taping this you are telling them I hope you don't mind because this can be a if you do then we\n04:03 - can take it off later but can you hear what they saying clearly okay yes um I had a few dreams uh actually many dreams all throughout the night it felt and um tell us the\n04:18 - best no I think the best I it wasn't like a dream it was just sort of like an image of you you had dreadlocks but they were like up in a bun like big that's me and my Shiva B yeah there were the hair\n04:32 - was glowing white beautiful yes that's the best and then there was another where we were in a shopping mall and it [Music] [Applause]\n04:47 - wased in chaotic shba goes America becomes American so so the Shiva form with the dreadlocks and the the thing tied on the head like that those three lines and all that's a Shiva form so he\n05:03 - he went with you to the uh to the mall right that's wonderful see he doesn't like or disliked he's very open wherever you take him he'll go with you so that was\n05:15 - very nice surprising were other people looking at the Shiva fellow uh no that was just a just an image it didn't even move I just saw you for just a moment you saw me in that form yes what else\n05:26 - did you see in that form on the face did you see the three marks here or did you see the Moon on top or did you see the third eye what did you see you were looking to the side so I couldn't see\n05:35 - the face but just the hair the hair really was built up like in sha pictures what was I wearing uh animal skin I don't Rec I think just the same as you're wearing now white yes in that\n05:48 - form yes okay and which was the other dream uh we were in the mall and it was just really crowded and busy and you were talking to me I don't remember exactly what you said but it felt like\n05:59 - you you were sort of explaining the the need for hard work and why why I need to work hard oh I was explaining the need for red wine or white wine hard work huh hard work work oh\n06:15 - hard work I heard hered wine okay okay then let's stay for hard work then what was the other dream um\n06:31 - I think I think that was it there were a few more that are really vague but there were many throughout the night good okay next yes uh with your dialogue I just distinctly remember uh meeting you\n06:45 - in the Middle with what you were saying in a sense and that I was more conscious of the fact that you were there and I was directing intent to ask you about what was happening to me and I just\n06:59 - distinctly call you showing me um every basically the general notion that there's nothing that can't be you in that what you were doing to work\n07:17 - with me mhm and that I feel uh resonated a lot especially when you're talking about it's Dream Weaver is it's not you don't have to just be asleep it's there's nothing that can't not be part\n07:30 - of it and um you just showed me that you were organizing a lot of things since I set the intention to come on this Retreat particularly the whole Retreat is a Dream Weaver\n07:49 - yeah but this is a very queer State he said something which is not in the nature of a western mind to say he said you showed me that there can be nothing that is not\n08:02 - you such a person is called a particular type of person uh on the fourth stage of saikal samadi can you tell me the name of such a type of person after an ABD or sidha\n08:16 - it's known as some type of a person a spiritual person can anybody tell me the name of that person yes what no he's not at the the samadi stage is still in the threedimensional\n08:34 - world when he experiences and he tells him that I am in every portion of nature I experience myself in the whole of prti I am in every atom of PR of the threedimensional world what am I\n08:50 - called what purush am I called what purush am I called if I experience I am absorbed in prti what what purush am I\n09:07 - called purush prti Dash purush prur is the stage that means the he is he Li means absorbed in every atom of Creation in the threedimensional\n09:23 - world that's called a PR AAR is higher than that but thear can come and give you give the experience or take on the facility of a prri like purush to work through prti prti means\n09:36 - nature Le means absorbed in every atom of the threedimensional nature so PR Le nature absorbed spiritual being purusha prti Pur how many have heard of this word prti purush raise one here so if if\n09:55 - the if you read That's only said in the book pangali so it is not said anywhere else no use anyway no you you you said it yesterday also in your talk yesterday yes yes you\n10:10 - use that term I don't know in what context I must use it but yes must be about the living Guru and the dead letter the dead book maybe in that context I used it yes\n10:27 - next um I usually have sleeping but yesterday I slept right away so thank you for that and a part of my dream was that you are my father and you're taking me to school\n10:41 - and I'm pretty young maybe 10 10 12 years old and we're going to school and we have to take the train and you get on the train first and I'm running behind and the train has left and you're\n10:54 - yelling at me like crazy like what's wrong with you run faster and they get on on the train and so I'm running and I'm crying I'm crying I'm like don't yell at me I'm trying and I'm\n11:07 - running on the train yelling at me um so that's the clear part of the dream so that that reminds me of sesar not that's what yukar would do he would not he would say run your own race come\n11:25 - on hold it he won't to give give make you catch then did you catch the train I'm not sure but I was crying I myself I myself have had dreams like that when I tried to help others their\n11:38 - dreams came to me and in those dreams I was running with the train and the train was suddenly getting faster and faster and the height was too much when the bar ends it when it goes off the platform\n11:50 - the platform goes down and the train becomes higher and just a that and quite a few times I've missed the train What a Feeling and then sometimes it's with a boat also\n12:03 - I've always got the boat I haven't missed the boat [Applause] ever you see what is happening with you all in this why we have this Satan when\n12:16 - you have the Dream Weaver when I appear to you in the dream I appear but it is suppressed at the back it's buried you don't remember it when others tell their experiences like you had then that pops\n12:29 - up and you experiences the memory recall comes after some time so your actually you remember but in initially you don't remember so later as it bubbles up from the surface of the mind's Lake you\n12:41 - remember that experience oh I also had one I remember now because it is suppressed by the later causal work that is done on you so I'm giving you time for it to Bubble Up the memory recall it\n12:53 - takes time so that's why I'm waiting with you to share this as to what work is being done on you and by saying this we invigorate and\n13:05 - Inspire each other to work more diligently in practicing Crea yoga yes uh I had Dream Weaver experiences before the Dream Weaver yes however I remember\n13:22 - asking this uh to uh you guys to take me back to New York because they're driving back to New York and when I was having the the dram W experience I saw a car\n13:34 - accident and I got scared so you're saved from the car accident you're saved yes you won't have it it's already done it's already done it's finished\n13:47 - that's why the Dream Weaver that's why you come here so gurunath gives you some little present or the other and makes you go forward because if you practice K sincerely then I have to save you I\n13:59 - can't delay your journey to God for some puny accident so this is this is very good and the Dream Weaver let me tells you it starts from the time you\n14:13 - sleep till the time you wake up at 2:00 you're with me dream weever starting and then you sleep again until until you wake up in the morning till you're here the dream weever still carrying\n14:24 - on even now it's carrying on yes last night I was very upset and I was in emotional pain and I made a request to you um in nonspecific terms I went to\n14:41 - sleep and I came to the dream weer kind of feeling differently but not better and this morning I woke up and I know I had a dream I think you were there but I couldn't remember\n14:57 - because I was so shocked when I opened my eyes I felt like I had never been here before and the sunlight coming in the window see it felt like the first time I'd ever seen it um and I looked at\n15:11 - the time and erased my memory of the dream but when I concentrated the one piece of the dream that I got back which I don't know I think it find funny I saw these rainbow gumdrops perhaps like the\n15:25 - chakras but they're gumdrops gum drops gumdrops like hand oh yeah yeah and they all have faces and they're all bouncing see excuse\n15:38 - me don't feel too pleased with yourself and don't feel bad I treat each one as for their intellectual level so I saw the child in you see everyone has a child in them there's\n15:59 - some deep rooted traumas can you imagine yourself at the age of five or four you would have been Overjoyed with that dream right that's that's your type of dream I mean that's the real thing the\n16:11 - real article you want to have Gumdrop chakras you can talk to them gululu how are you oh little teddy oh little giraffe and you just wake them up and talk to each of those little animals\n16:23 - this is such a joke yeah but this is a this is a serious and a good work and uh the coming in the ray of the sunlight coming in is that is a\n16:34 - beginning of a new spiritual life A Renewed spiritual life this is important yes",

          "title": "Achieving A Purified Transformed Mind",
          "transcript": "00:02 - the only purpose of man's seran on this Earth is to seek God before you die before you finish with your physical body and all your\n00:19 - nuts and bols have become rusted you should have dissolve your mind before your body becomes rusted and invalid and not useful and the nuts and bols start creaking in\n00:33 - your joints and you become a rusted entity due to constant usage you know the body is being used so like a vehicle or Auto it tires and it gets wear and tear so\n00:45 - before the wear and te of your body you should have dissolved your mind that is the Race Against Time and the race in phenomena is that the Mind should have totally dissolved before you\n00:58 - die that is the perfect har if you have a me messy mind it's no use because the main thing which leads to all these problems all these uh complex situations\n01:16 - in your life is the doing of the Dual mind the mind is dual always because it's in Duality and there is a\n01:35 - process of purifying the Mind by the breath like you say the breath purifies the\n01:58 - mind like the Gent abrasion of the breath on an erratic mind rounds it off smoothens it flattens it thins it makes it subtler transforms\n02:17 - it till the Mind gradually by constant rhythmic breathing the Mind dissolves Longs of practice are required you don't have to believe in\n02:38 - God you are God you don't have to believe in God you are God and by the gentle abrasion of the mind of the breath on the mind when the Mind dissolves God\n02:53 - Appears like there's a saint which have taken from the ancient Saints is that you rub the Tinder and the fire appears you press the seed and the oil\n03:10 - appears and you breathe the man and God Appears so it's it has to be so simple and the simpler you keep your mind and keep breathing you don't have to believe in God you are God but if you\n03:23 - keep breathing rhythmically that gentle abrasion of the breath will gradually dissolve your mind before your body can die you should be out of your body you should make your release in\n03:35 - this life it's not impossible but it is so it is so simple you only require the discipline of daily practice it's very simple breathe with awareness breathe with\n03:51 - awareness and that is the Alchemy of Total Transformation breathing with awareness can transform the most negative Mind by gradual\n04:09 - process as the gentle waves of the river lap upon the shores if you seen the Narada river river because the rivers constantly\n04:24 - flowing and the Stones become round they become well rounded so by constant breathing first your personality will become well rounded all your psychological Kings\n04:36 - will disappear and then as even if it's rounded like a shing if you keep breathing it becomes smaller and smaller and smaller your mind becomes smaller and thinner and thinner and thinner till\n04:47 - the Mind disappears and when the Mind disappears you appear you and the mind cannot stay together but now you think your you are not you are the mind and not the the\n05:03 - spirit so you put the hands of your mind upon the eyes of your soul and cry that you cannot see you put the hands of your mind upon\n05:15 - the eyes of your soul and cry that you cannot see take the hands of your mind away from the eyes of the soul and behold yourself to be divine and what is the taking of the hands of the Mind away\n05:28 - from the soul constant practice of K yog how many of you have practiced K yog here raise your hands who has not got K yog who is not got everybody has good so firstly there are three things\n05:47 - basically which the mind is composed of vti which are the immediate random thoughts the world pools the twistings and turnings of the mind which can be dissolved in the\n06:01 - conscious level in a state of concentration right V which are random thoughts then there are deeper set\n06:16 - thoughts which may have taken form which are known as PR which are thought forms these thought forms are in the deeper mind in the deeper subconscious mind but\n06:30 - they are not remembered they are remembered experiences of this life and then there are some scars which are remembered experiences of past life so in\n06:43 - meditation you can dissolve by pranayam and meditation the first stage of the mind's turbulence which is vti okay but said the is the transformation of the modifications of\n06:59 - the Mind so briti is the first level of random thoughts which you can tackle with the breath and pran in your state of meditation but then there's a deeper\n07:10 - state which is called not just thoughts but thoughts have forms so the thought has created a form and this is called PR this has to be resoled in a state of deep meditation\n07:26 - and first stages of sadii in the stage of sap samadi where you get fleeting experiences of derp but you that is in a state a thought-free state of awareness will help you to\n07:40 - separate the Consciousness from the mind so that's a meditation then first stage of samadi dissolve but the some scars which are remembered experiences of past lives are not even dissolved in\n07:57 - sa you have to go to the superc conscious state of medit of uh the superc conscious ecstasy the Ecstasy of expanded Consciousness superc conscious that is\n08:11 - Nal samadi so when you keep practicing Nal samadi then the remembered experience of past life gradually dissolve and go away and when your mind is in a state of contentless\n08:25 - consciousness when it is a thought free state of awareness and there are no the thoughts not even a single thought there in your mental sky and in your conscious Sky then you are set to be in a state of\n08:38 - seedless sadii s samadi or the thought-free state of awareness so first your at the first stage your thoughts random thoughts are dissolved in a state of breathing and meditation k\n08:53 - yog then your thought forms which are deeper they are thought images visuals with thoughts are dissolved in states of samadi like the thought\n09:05 - State samadi and your ssars which are remembered experiences of past lives are dissolved in a state of n which we\n09:20 - called it go this it goes to a state ofal then the ssar pull it back to S then it goes to Nal then toal and when all the some scars are\n09:36 - dissolved remember experience of this in past life then your Consciousness goes to NP and doesn't come back again to s samadi that is a stage known as the seedless Sam which\n09:50 - is in yogic Plants it is called Beach the SE and then you have to wait and not do anything anything because you in a state you have\n10:03 - broken this the the the speed of the electron you have broken all matter the last phase of matter is the electron and you pass from saal into n samadi which\n10:18 - is known as the N Sami the seedless Sami and you remain in that state of seed but that is that is done by what when I work with you when I give you a thing called\n10:33 - Shiva that is working on your purva soundcar your own or thoughts you can dissolve and evolve your own thought forms which are you can evolve by but your on scars you\n10:48 - need the grace of the guru to help you to get into a state of shaath shaath is a state of thought free awareness a state of thought free Enlightenment which the guru projects his thought free\n10:60 - state of Enlightenment into your mind and is in empathy with you and makes you experience that thought free state and dissolve your s scar your remembered experience of past life by separating\n11:12 - your Consciousness from your mind once your Consciousness is separated from your mind then the mind is starved by slow degrees it has nothing to feed on when\n11:24 - your mind has no thoughts to feed on it slows and dies a slow death the moment the guru help your mind to die you are free to fly the way of the white\n11:39 - squ so now you have to tune in to me remember I never preach or give lectures this is an excuse because via my vibrations I'm transmitting and if you are if you are you get healed to the\n11:58 - degree that you are aware from a little pain in your toenail to cancer all can be healed depending upon your degree of empathy with me your Synergy your degree of\n12:13 - rle so the more tune you are with me the sky is the limit because I have no mind I am only Consciousness the mind is an excuse for me to Incarnate into Duality and give\n12:29 - these things so people always miss the thing preaching and always I even if I sayra bura MRA I will still you because the vibration will hit you I say still the vibration so words are a\n12:44 - facility they are irrelevant as far as I'm concerned I Don't Preach I'm not a preacher I don't teach I'm not a teacher I come you to catch you to shake you and wake you\n12:57 - up teachers teachers inform Masters transform Masters never teach if they teach it's just as an excuse you know make your supery mind we very intellectual nothing got to do\n13:15 - naked truth has nothing to do with all this talk these are the all talks and philosophies are the mere babblings of a child says sh gor shababa tell your\n13:29 - flows in your central Channel till your is awakened all philosophies and talks are the M babblings of child that's why we don't give all this talk and all these philosophies any\n13:45 - important I've got cancer I've got this thing you should do this you should take two arms you should that's all talk can you can you transmit or can you blow your breath into my being into my\n13:57 - soul and cure my cancer that is the question if you can do it then you're the being follow such a man otherwise don't waste your time in this world sit alone and play sincerely to your soul\n14:11 - the answer lies within I am just a projection of you within I'm here because you have called me forth I'm just a figure I've been molded from your Soul\n14:22 - Essence I am the mold of your spirit just like people get the government they deserve people get the guru they deserve you guys must have done quite a bit of good\n14:35 - stuff have a guy badman like you must a lot of bad you don't have the best Guru because you know he he cannot get his words across to\n14:46 - you he can only get his experience and whenever I talk whether it's my videos or lectures always bear in mind that if you if you don't listen to my lecture and just sit in front of my my sound\n14:57 - which is talking you will be here try it go to the YouTube try it so we Ms and shakers we catch you shake you and wake you up okay talk is just a\n15:09 - facility it's just a means to an end because you're so used to talking and engaging at the mental level suddenly come and take say he's very rude he didn't give any EPO EPO or any\n15:25 - introduction or any any this thing and he just came and took us to the state but if you see what I'm talking is a transmission even now children can feel\n15:40 - [Music] it so we can meditate a little if you're if you're harmony with me if you're in sink with me you'll get to a thought free\n15:53 - state I'll take you on the little flight I'll be transmitting I'm on already there you see the difference you will create the shortcoming or whatever for\n16:05 - the total reception will be if your mind disturbs you from my side I have no mind so I'll give you the full transion so sit quiet close your eyes your body is the\n16:19 - temple you are the white swan in the third eye your body is the temple you are the soul SW raise your soul SW to the top of your\n16:36 - head Clap Your Wings you are the purple star which is the shape of the SW the top point is the head the side point of the stars are the wings and the two legs\n16:49 - at the bottom all the way of the purple star of the East and let the star flap its purple wings and fly higher and higher leave your body Temple behind and fly\n17:03 - higher and higher merge into Mo break the embroid of the be surfed with it\n17:21 - saturate every molecule of the filled with the nectar of life and love penetrate the of the Moon and fly higher and higher you are the hamsa\n17:35 - Swan fly into the deep star Skies Higher and Higher and hamsa studed with the Stars the jewel wings of Blaze and bound\n17:59 - the boundless land of ever wondrous peace and joy and as you fly higher and higher you taste to the free spirit of the lord your wings are spread from eternity to\n18:18 - Eternity you're going to the boundless land and as your wings take a golden you of burnished gold you enter the central spiritual Sun they drink of the wisdom and the\n18:31 - knowledge of the world penetrate the over the Sun and fly higher and higher you are the vast and white and big swor of\n18:47 - Eternity you are so vast that you lose your form you fly higher and higher and merge into s\n19:01 -

about the role of Crea yog with the physical body this gentleman who has given the testimonial has already uh kind of answered it but uh a lot of people are asking similar questions can\n01:34:36 - we correct our physical form through breath work including bone of the skull and Jaws another lady is asking can I correct hormonal imbalance through Crea yog and uh her situation with pituitary\n01:34:53 - tumor another person is asking how to heal his cancer if you dwell on the disease and your physical malady it will remain do not\n01:35:11 - dwell do not dwell on the physical disease of Darkness put on the light of positive thinking think of your sadguru and practice Kaa yog and you will make progress\n01:35:25 - and even if you don't don't be body conscious be Spirit conscious be Atma conscious this is very very important this is very important I would suggest one thing to you get into the\n01:35:40 - stream register and practice K yog practice K yog and then the good Lord will tell you he will give you inner pleasure Inner Light in inner\n01:35:55 - Divinity you are not the body the perishable body but you are the Divine soul to all of you my answer this first take Kaa yog and secondly 10 times before going to bed say I'm not the\n01:36:08 - perishable body I'm the Divine Soul I'm not the perishable body I'm the Divine Soul I'm not this perishable body I'm the Divine Soul so get to your true identity you are not a perishable body\n01:36:19 - you are a Divine soul next all those questions answered now I will get on if you want me to wait I will wait a little more if people are wanting to join in I will wait for them\n01:36:57 - but what is the next question you better tell me when to start the initiation okay we can take time maybe for one more question is there anybody in person who wishes to ask another\n01:37:11 - question yeah Ram gurunath I wonder at times that are we going deeper into meditation or is it who who is talking I'm here\n01:37:32 - where Punam from Hawaii Punam from Hawaii pram gurunath Okay you're from Hawaii I'm from India but I'm living in Hawaii currently okay so um sometimes I wonder if it is\n01:37:49 - deeper meditation or is it a deep sleep that one gets into how do we differentiate that because you talk about Culp\n01:38:01 - nerval be samadi but these are just words until we experience or understand that so if you what she say I cannot hear oh he said are these what did she say is\n01:38:15 - this this or that or something she asked my my question is essentially when I meditate um I sometimes confuse whether I'm sleeping or is it a deeper State um\n01:38:32 - the only difference I feel is like a steam hitting the pot lid of the pot um and you have talked about different stages um nalp n be cervical but they seem like words\n01:38:50 - until they seem like words until you have faith in the sguru your faith is lacking increase your faith who is your sguru uh he's from India yeah then you go to him and ask him if he can't do it\n01:39:03 - then come to me I will do it I can't transgress you have to go through him I'm very particular about protocol the proper Channel must be done and we cannot intervene who is your\n01:39:16 - sguru what is his name his name is ranir Bari so he's a guru a teacher yes so you have to go to a master from a teacher so if you're coming for initiation with me keep my photo there start the practice\n01:39:32 - say gurunath help me and I'll start helping you have full faith and do it no problem if it doesn't happen your faith is lacking not my presence because for tens of thousands of people I've come\n01:39:43 - there and it's always been a success gurunath works so not I think that uh we have to wrap up the YouTube live and move on to the uh Ona empowerment now move\n01:40:07 - on yeah let's take a break yes we need to because we have time what is the time now 9:20 9:20 so 93 for those on YouTube\n01:40:26 -

          "transcript": "00:00 - e [Music] oh Guru Brahma Guru Vishnu gur\n01:18 - [Music] m i bow to the indwelling spirit residing in all of you and the whole of humanity saat is and we begin the satsung\n01:42 - today so today you are being given a special technique which is called the youthing and younging technique which I will be giving to you\n01:58 - you have to practice this on and off it is not the original Kaa technique but this is from the shivanan yog it's a very Advanced and very effective\n02:10 - technique if you do it the success of your Technique will depend upon the degree of concentration applied and the repetition of course it is called the technique of spiritual\n02:28 - growth that is youthing and younging you not only Youth and Young in your physical body but you're youthing and younging towards a new spiritual world as you approach more and more\n02:43 - towards God you become younger and younger till when you get into God's lap you're a little child right that's how you would like to be when you approach the Lord small innocent like a\n02:57 - child so this is it and uh yes yes tell me loudly tell me loudly doesn't matter first is the first is the introduction session which I'm I'm\n03:13 - introducing all the people let me have their photos in the front right rather than my picture I'm introducing them to the technique that they will be\n03:24 - getting those who join in from the YouTube They will also aware of this technique but till then before that I will give an introduction as to yoga and why the yog sadna is done with question\n03:36 - answers is that right put them on [Music] [Music] so all you people present on the YouTube I heard I hope you heard what I I said\n04:27 - that first I will be giving the introduction we are going to talk about yog and question answers and after that there will be a break when you will register and then I\n04:39 - will give the youing and younging it's not more about the technique it is about the spiritual energy and transmission which gurunath gives to the\n04:51 - disciples which makes them evolve via the technique right called youing and younging of course youing and younging is a\n05:04 - secondary portion of Enlightenment as you get towards Enlightenment your body becomes younger and more youthful all your body's physical emotional mental and spiritual bodies\n05:18 - they become youth till you become so innocent so youthful and so young like a child and only the pure child can merge into God your mind should be as pure as a nent newborn\n05:35 - child so the youing and younging is the physical portion of the technique which I'm giving you because this is the physical part of the spiritual portion which makes your mind very simple and\n05:49 - pure and thought-free like that of a youth of a young child and your physical body also becomes healthier and stronger and younger the\n06:03 - degree of progress in the youing and younging technique at the physical emotional and spiritual level will depend upon the degree of concentration you apply towards the technique it is\n06:14 - not the main Crea technique but it is a technique of shivanan yog where which are Advanced Techniques you can do do it twice a week you can do it five times a week this is to give you a\n06:28 - boost a healthy body and Healthy Mind merges more easily into God the Supreme Consciousness as I have told you before that we must\n06:46 - understand what yog is before we learn to practice and get on with the practice of yog yog means Union Unity the joining of jaiva with Shiva in the\n07:05 - spiritual sense the merging of your individual Drop in the Ocean of Consciousness the transformation of your life of Relativity into your life of reality this is what yoga means y join\n07:24 - the merg of J Atma into shivatma now let's see what happens when you practice yog when we sit down to practice what is it we don't sing loudly tomorrow please remove this\n07:51 - before I come otherwise I will have to do another sashtang dwat in front of all the lady disciples sashtang namaskar to the Davies and I went like\n08:07 - this they very pleased about [Laughter] it so you must understand that the the process of yog of\n08:23 - course yog sad it starts with the physical body the physical as aspect of doing yogas flexing your spine with danasan bujangan these are all spine flexing\n08:40 - exercises which which which facilitate your Consciousness to rise more easily from muladar Chakra to sahastra chakra where it merges into the superc consciousness\n09:04 - it merges into the Super Consciousness it's like the Kundalini is a very simple energy it's a form she is very humble and\n09:16 - quiet at the base of the spine the kundal is a fire the Kundalini is the lady of the Cinders the\n09:31 - burning Cinders the muladar chakra the spiritual fire the Agni jwala so she is the Lady of the Cinders Kundalini is\n09:44 - Cinderella you know how Cinderella you heard of the story of Cinderella when you were children she comes and she has to marry the Prince When the prince comes the magic breath comes the godm\n09:58 - and due to the pranayam she Rises and Cindy rushes up the chimney of the spine and a whole Aura her whole appearance from the Su Kundalini to the\n10:11 - jagat Kundalini and all her Splendor all her beauty and all her glory she comes and the magic is performed in the body of the human being where the Charming godmother comes the godm mother is is\n10:25 - the is the main ADI shaki which awakens your individual Cinderella Kini Cinderella and Cinderella Kundalini the lady of the Cinders Rises up the chimney of the spine to meet her prince charming\n10:38 - at sahasrar this is the way I put it I've given a very very deep meaning to a western fairy tale\n10:48 - but but the Indian mind is such that it spiritualizes even even Hickory Dickory Dock the mouse ran up the clock the mind of the setup of the Indian Yogi is such that he sees everything even nursery\n11:02 - rhymes and poet poems as a process of yoga and approach of the Jaa and Cinderella meeting a prince J jaming as the Manus budhi merge into the Atma so this is the Fanning of the\n11:18 - Kundalini by the breath of Kaa are you people who are listening to me are you getting this this analogy are you getting this very clearly right and you like the analogy too since all\n11:33 - you didn't waste your time in kindergarten learning baba black sheep they all have a spiritual meaning so therefore yes\n11:45 - yes Christine now then you go on to the emotional aspect of yog after the physical aspect as the Kundalini Rises to the Heart Center you do your bti en\n12:02 - chanting right so that also opens the Lotus of the heart and facilitates the rising of the Kundalini the shy which gives you makes you aware\n12:20 - of who you are you're not this house of Flesh and Bone which sleeps decays and dies you are Immortal Consciousness lord of the earth and skies but how to realize this\n12:35 - if you chant biti if you chant biti then the ego is dissolved and your mind becomes purified and you have to chant simple bi like I said\n13:01 - [Music] oh Lord let thy form ever be before my mind's eye and let thy name ever be upon my lips let not a moment go by but I'm not saying\n13:42 - I feel that the ancient signs of the yogis where they called God Allah Nan the Eternal truth of dazzling Splendor the word Allah soon became the word Allah this is how what I intuitionally\n13:58 - feel not that one took from the other is just which is one more ancient than the other however all the religions and casts and Creeds of the world are one and you keep\n14:09 - chanting oh Lord even if I don't meet you you are rooted in my breath it doesn't matter that I haven't seen you that I haven't meet met you [Music]\n14:42 - [Music] so the meaning of this is it is biti it hits the heart and opens the Lotus of your heart you know oh Lord whether I meet you or not\n15:02 - doesn't matter you are rooted in my breath you are rooted she she ra ma ra Ma so it doesn't matter but you rooted in my breath and in that\n15:19 - rooting of the breath means you are the one to be served and I am your servant to you are the one who I'm singing my devotion to and I am the singer of your\n15:40 - love you are the one to whom I am doing the job and I am the japi I am the japy and you are the one who jaia is being done to means who is near my heart close to me\n16:03 - walking with me all these words you are still I can feel your presence like all of you felt my presence before I came right that is the way to do it when gurunath actually comes you can see his\n16:16 - presence but to see is not so important in the world of Relativity the first step is to feel the presence of the master before he comes if you can can feel my presence 10 minutes before I\n16:31 - come then you are ready for my sad then you are ready for me to evolve you how many felt my presence before I came 10 minutes before raise your hands and how many didn't how many didn't you didn't\n16:45 - because your mind was preoccupied when you come to this Hall place like I tell you I have wov this asham out of the web of my own being like a spider weave its web and those\n17:01 - who get caught in my web of Freedom shall never be in bondage again those of you those of you who didn't uh clap uh I will assume that you did not understand what I was saying or\n17:22 - you your your hands are below the screen so who's this gentleman in red to the right very nice smile he's got on who's that huh frish frish\n17:37 - what Shahar sh mean shivar okay and that's dgan is there Dougan Dougan now Dougan is is it very cold\n17:51 - what is the temperature there tell me in this is it this or is it this 7° how much is it 6 60 6° lucky you fre your way to God guys\n18:07 - freeze your way to God and bti does something if you're in a cold country and the Lotus of your heart is Frozen the chanting melts the eyes so the Lotus of the heart opens\n18:24 - up abinash this was not for you to clap this was for 5-year-old children so they they believe it but you also believed it right so then you go on to the higher States you've done your ass then you've\n18:38 - done your medit you've done your biti and all these beautiful things no bi is so beautiful and he says in B yog I don't like this black streak here let me put this in just hold your\n18:57 - horses have some patience so there's one song it's very nice when I was a child the Lotus of my heart opened up and it gave me the urgency of what I should do\n19:13 - in life why should I waste time I should not waste time you know we have wasted so much time and you know like uh this girl Priyanka she used to come from the very\n19:27 - beginning but her sister wasted a lot of time in in coming lot of time and then she comes along today and she's got that volunteer thing immediately how does that happen I don't know but anyway\n19:38 - that's good you wasted time so it says do not waste time life is short do not waste time it is very very important so this when I was small this\n19:53 - this mendicant the fak used to come and the the the sadu and used to a very simple song and I was wondering what he said this is also part of b y I'm\n20:08 - talking about what I'm explaining to you what yog is first is the karma yog where you do your physical actions and dedicate all of them to God then the S Karma yog\n20:20 - where you do your yogas and physical actions dedicate to God then is the bti yog then is the Gyan yog and then is Raj yog so in the B he used to say used to say if you can't make it now\n20:57 - bud you will never never make it then procrastination is the thief of time do not put it off until tomorrow oh I've got a cold today I can't do K don't if you don't got a cold then do chanting\n21:12 - man I can't walk today so I can't meditation sit down and meditate oh my nose is blocked so I can't do K where there's no breathing involved\n21:26 - but don't make excuses if you can't make it now you will never make it then [Music] so all this money and wealth and name and fame and all your friends will lie\n22:09 - in front of you all waste all this money and wealth and all the property and everything you earned will be of no use if you do not seek Him who is in all\n22:29 - so if you die ignorant you will have to renounce everything you have earned in this life and all your material wealth and all your\n22:38 - friends but if you can seek the Lord before your physical death then in him is all your wealth in him is all your money in him or in the Supreme Essence I should not say him or her I should not\n22:54 - say god or goddess I should use the word goddesses because the language has to be corrected we were we were oriented in a certain way but now the world is changed because\n23:09 - people and ladies ask me God sir how do we know that God is only a he and not a she so I tell them you're right he is both and Beyond he is both and Beyond\n23:24 - then sir can you coin another name can you say another name so then I coin this word goddess g o d e SS goddess e s c n c God Ence so do you like this word then join me on the\n23:43 - journey to the infite so make wealth you have to be you have to be in the now you have to be in the now if you want to be happy begin where you are\n24:11 - don't wait for some Rapture that's future and far begin to be happy begin to be glad and soon you'll forget that you ever were sad so the happy and gladness what do the hus call happy\n24:26 - happy and glad they call him satand begin to be saand begin to be happy begin to be joyous this is open and how do we do this in\n24:38 - yog what is the technique the technique to be happy and glad is by K yog but gurun how would you practice K yog in B\n24:57 - yog this is my favorite song for K yog now I've got a cold I can't do Kaa so what do I do B yog I do the Kaa by singing song of Kaa The J door is Kaa yog\n25:21 - [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]\n25:56 - what a nice word G1 life and what a simple rustic word d Dori Dori shidori shidori is what does shidori mean that is a shidori but what is a Dori in the sh is\n26:19 - the pool and the Dori is this the pr no so B yog is very nice [Music] so I'm I'm so unhappy because God has made me lame they've made her she's\n26:45 - dancing and this thing no you should have content this fellow has got all the money and he can he can go to kumb and be in the AC tent I don't have the money I'll go in the dhala in the CT with all\n26:57 - this thing so everything is there see even K and Raj does not satisfy the heart maybe it's in relativity like biti nothing satisfies\n27:24 - like it gives you the wings to s in the highest heaven and it satisfies your emotional being oh God we don't want to S satisfy emotional being we want to go to Nal samadi but let me tell you one\n27:40 - secret it is a stepbystep process unless you complete and satisfy your physical process from sex you cannot get to samadi unless you satisfy your emotional process of bti you cannot get to shaki\n27:57 - and unless you satisf your sh of Raj andini K yog you cannot get to Shiva so it is a step by step it is very this thing so how does that one start\n28:28 - what a beautiful songs I mean I'm saying that even if I didn't learn K this thing and I went to bti I would still reach you see the philosophy of content in India is what makes India go forward\n28:49 - you're not cing over your circumstances apartment and these ladies have gone to Ash don't worry medit in the apartment and say Lord I'm here I'm not able to go\n29:01 - to s next day gurunath and the Lord will give you circumstances that you will come here do not make excuses do not make excuses in whatever\n29:21 - circumstances this is very important this is supposed to be an introductory satsang before the technique but I cannot help I'm already transmitting to you I'm\n29:31 - charging you and I'm evolving your Consciousness and your your biti status so for me there's no introductory satsung the satsung is actually started so these are it's it's very very\n29:45 - nice it's very very nice it's very beautiful and all the all the philosophies yeah are given in all our biti and songs then you get on to another the the\n29:59 - higher state where you have to have Gan yog philosophy and T and by philosophy and T by discussing philosophy your mind is\n30:13 - molded to that state of trying to realize the essence of God who he actually is trying to find out by meditating on the shadow chakras by silencing our mind and then ultimately\n30:25 - you come to the Raj yog where you go into vria yog which is the Hat yog you go into Raj yog so all these processes of yoga whether they involve B\n30:42 - yog Karma yog bti yog Gan yog or Raj yog the four major yog it's still yog is an inner asent through ever more refined and ever more expanded\n31:02 - spheres of mind to get to the god Essence which lies at the core of your own being this is what yoga is let this be very clear this is very\n31:19 - important whenever I talk to you I don't talk I'm transforming you sitting in the presence of a teacher is listening to his lecture sitting in the presence of a master is the Alchemy of total\n31:37 - transform Alchemy of total transformat do you get it and you can feel it now are there any question answers question answers I think we will\n31:53 - give the actual satsang which will start in that I will give the question answ so now I will have the break all those who want to join me in the technique and future question answers please be with\n32:07 - me after the break uh there's a process of entering into the initiated Forum where I will initiate so please join that initiated Forum the registration and I will see\n32:21 - you after this I will end the satsang now to begin after 15 minutes om sh [Music] [Music]\n32:48 - [Laughter] [Music]",

after-effects of the music and music is very close to spirituality so I'd like to bless you all today on this auspicious day the whole team that you get success in whatever it's a great\n04:42 - service to humanity it brings harmony and coexistence amongst the people of the earth music is a create media to bring harmony and peaceful coexistence amongst our sections\n05:06 - [Music] [Music] music with obvious transform into the vibrations of the person they enter what chemistry shall be formally between the\n05:47 - musician who plays the music and the audience who hears the music depending upon the state of heart of the audience if he is full of joy than his heart will be healing through joy and if he is full\n06:05 - of havana and his heart would be healed through valor and if he is full of anger god bless him may he direct that anger in the correct direction to destroy his own anger that's the vaccination process\n06:23 - you see when you go and you have a thorn in your leg in the forest there is no needles or pins you take another throne as a needle and with that tone you remove the thorn so there is a yogic\n06:34 - technique whereby with anger if you could destroy handle like the vaccination you put the same essence of that the disease or disorder and actually if the personality becomes a\n06:45 - new trend so also music plays wonderful Roman Road and spirituality it helps in the alchemy of total transformation and forms an essential part of bhakti oh the yoga of devotion helps to have do the\n07:04 - invoke and surrender it with love and honor at the feet of the Lord so all glory be to music music Andrea [Applause] nobody has told me in the good fortune\n07:32 - of program what is happening but I'm assuming that I'm supposed to keep talking and blessings also excellent that they have to program there is still they don't know what to do next what is\n07:51 - the next of the agenda but I don't want to spoil your sequence of program so tell me what we have what you have to do is your satsang for the and then we're going to have Prashad to that offer some\n08:10 - sweets for you and then you bless and give a shot for the other people so today is the auspicious day of California not when the Guru is ready to offer this heart in order to serve\n08:33 - humanity but let me tell you whenever a disciple is in total at one went with the master so many times it is guru Poornima for the disciple means that which satisfies your heart and makes it\n09:07 - move like the full moon if it's a half-hearted attempt then it is only out of the for the poor give up water Poornima with your des attentive out of the courtly math when you're half inches\n09:26 - in and if they have a word for this don't do a HHH job [Laughter] ha ha ha ha hot dog laughs twice so it's in tandem gracefully bringing your would\n10:05 - have to react for spiritual interpretation I hope you like that and empathy with the master for you the word makeover applies but you and the spiritual master and your spiritual\n10:24 - essence is important amount it is the full moon of your delight and the Satguru there's a constant for Imam is he is ever fully moon for the disciples but you only see him as the water moon\n10:45 - or half moon as much as to the extent you can grasp it you know so you are at one with with the master to the extent you know the master your environment you are holding out with the circle to the\n11:04 - extent you'll know him as the full moon you know have a support level so it's all and how much how open you are positively into the subgroup and how well you can let go let go of the past\n11:19 - let go of negativity so it's a very good idea to contact people who you've met before whom you had rough edges with or or knocks and tatters here and there and make friends with them\n11:39 - you can directly meet them and say hey let's forget about it let's bury the hatchet no bad luck the whole zone of love will of work from my heart and let's be one\n11:51 - and good friends again you can phone them you can meet them you can sing to them whatever the occasion and the person to person is so when you do that from your side you're not what the other\n12:01 - person makes the process of getting there on modern high high drama that moment they follow that moment therefore therefore I've always said to people let there be a guru Poornima between the\n12:16 - relations of one nation and the other of one person and the other and first it starts with one person at the other harmonizing of the full moon of their blossoming hearts and the same\n12:28 - blossoming heart of how many was taken to the society then to the community then to the humanity and the nations will live in peace and harmony don't worry about what they are doing earth\n12:43 - peace through self peace if you have the full moon of peace if you have the full moon of peace for tomorrow and the world will be in Guru Poornima they will harmony with one another so charity\n12:57 - begins at home love begins at home everything begins at home in your spiritual heart you cannot change the world if you change the world each one changes himself into the full\n13:10 - moon of Guru Poornima then everyone will be the full moon of Guru Poornima of love wisdom and joy I know this doesn't make sense in the practical world for the practical world\n13:30 - offer business meetings or for economics this is nonsense but I am speaking of super sense I'm speaking beyond the senses and because thematically needs to raise itself let go of the darkness\n13:45 - behind let forth all the ego clashes all the problems begin with evil if you step aside and say ok Frank you win the other fellow feels too embarrassed because you're mudslinging\n14:01 - and dumb sting so if you say ok buddy is ready to attack you say ok buddy you're right you win and so he does know he's left all the dung cakes in his hand it's like you have to put it on his face\n14:19 - so you shatter his hatred by now that's what the subgroups deep thought over the world to shatter hatred with love and to give your best what does it matter if he wins the race let them do it is\n14:36 - satisfying bingo you be magnanimous you take the step back and say ok you're the winner 1 and you win and then the world will look to you and not to him it speaks for you and not for him remember\n14:51 - that cry at once fantasy undefeated the other finger you know later like the grandfather and grandson have an argument a grandson says\n15:01 - this is okay yeah very well when he loses in a game of chess but sometimes the grandfather radius to lose to the resume whatever the other day I had a swimming test with a few generations and\n15:16 - the swimming math with my grandson and obviously I've gotten since he was five how to swim and then he gets up at fifteen and I want to race it so that I recently three generations I'm here the\n15:33 - grandfather then the father's age danke and then the grandson and the Swiss and the all swimming I think because I taught them the son was right over the grandson\n15:44 - the water main is same strength also at full speed the banister too son always but the age matters people who always asked what we were swimming to rhythm and perfection so what I'm trying to say\n16:02 - is be the best you can you cannot be the best of the best but I tell you and if you are humble humility does it all and those who are rested in humidity and burning with love have already found\n16:22 - their guru Poornima have already found their I'm speaking to you as it comes because you thought I am prepared for your speech I said what should I prepare\n16:39 - they're all people are brothers sisters cousins I don't need to prepare anything for them if you want to possess the same war story at every house same old story and we do the same old things every time\n16:55 - but selves intimately hi and they asked me little stiff I said okay all the same so I asked the question I said how many other children and I wanted to show the similarity of the common human habit how\n17:12 - many of you have a stick job chocolates when you were young so they all put their hands up how many of you have signature doctors when you have sticky toffee stick your thumb prints how many\n17:22 - here raise your hands okay and how many of you are fact that that the stick to chocolates sometimes stuck to the graves you're not okay and how many are initially of you have tried\n17:35 - to remove it with your tongue and how many of you have failed to move into the region and that how many of you updated this figure and raise your hands a similarity\n17:52 - we've all done it and it's so with you but you asked everyone to say hey and who played us we're all different so there's some almond dealer and Audrina VNA which makes a similar\n18:02 - human behavior it's really so simple but it's surprising that you see so many that is raising the hands and it breaks the ice of humanity that we are different we are not different\n18:14 - humanities are uniting religion recognising prayer and consciousness are uniting God these are not the words but I was talking what the commonality of the stick job talking\n18:29 - nobody it doesn't bend it so this is the finger so there's a commonality there many other common habits if you if you say it's very hilarious we all do the same things maybe they're programmed\n18:53 - that will as the human race and people all over the world are sitting here they have the same common habits so there is a link between us not at the not at the level of consciousness which there is\n19:05 - not at the level of breath which there is not at the level no not even at the level of energy transformation or so residents but even at the level of physical habits so we are a big family\n19:18 - and we need to get United this is the message of Guru Poornima we need to get you United but there does not have to be a unity in unity if it's not still work for Humanity because they can always be\n19:33 - a unity in diversity also different nations people can still live in peaceful coexistence the first we have to mend yourself alert peace through self peace\n19:46 - I have always said that if earth peace is to herald the dawn of the new age we must all realize and practice humanity as are uniting region breath as are uniting prayer the Kriya breath and\n20:08 - consciousness as I am $19 so today I intend to united in consciousness many of you are new many of you are coming the first time because demise always and open a love for all subsets enough for\n20:30 - all so very very interesting is a very beautiful go-to for anybody I am some of humanity and I always remind myself of that so no ego should come up I'm the boss I\n20:49 - have the moral high ground no you don't no you're not you're a server of humanity but in you serving humanity humanity will raise you to the skies if you try to raise yourself to the sky I\n21:04 - am this and that then there will be a big fall there'll be a hunting don t fall and all the king's horses and all the king's men you won't lose this point it's a very\n21:16 - sophisticated for a very deeply spiritual moment I tell you about the Eagles and Humpty Dumpty had a great fall that will follow the English and then once the ego Falls then you cannot\n21:33 - put it together again it gets reprimanded but the soul the ego itself feels very bad but in the end the fall is good because the ego can never be repaired again once it is destroyed and\n21:47 - humble and then only the essence of God flows through you instead of ego not what can I do for myself what can I do for you what will you learn that's right I think let open this husband and wife\n21:59 - there will never be a clash you ask your wife what can I do for you and she returned must must answer what can I do for you so there's nothing selfishly or this offering it to the other and then\n22:14 - they come to a mutual agreement and it goes on but don't say that it means innovation say you first see listen to what I say but use common sense what we are going to see you first you first and\n22:33 - the elevator will go up and down ten times when we say 20 first use was so don't do that I had an incident with a Japanese gentleman once so he did this right with this\n22:46 - and the elevator went not much ever need will impact again but you know you first use was up belly-up and it it happens is etiquette so this is the\n23:00 - way to do think of others defense yourself in the surface fathers I know it's very difficult to talk easier said than done but I have done it and that's what I'm saying it this is the way to\n23:17 - solve all problems immediately just government right with your partner you first it will be wonderful immediately something wrong just taken the pagan coming here and then bossing around so\n23:43 - it's good you can do it with enterprise lay your evil side do this is privacy so wonderful thing I take you to do this and if you do this it will work miracles don't do it in an emergency of course\n23:57 - then you grab what you have to grab your wife of jump out of the window otherwise don't know you first you first in an emergency okay I said common in a second common sense\n24:07 - has to be live speaking in the context of a spirit spiritual situation where you can be tension free of course today is full for demand therefore I need to say something about the sacred science\n24:23 - of creative how many do not have creative overcome new for the first time raise your hands first time brings it right up okay so create over is an essential part of\n24:39 - our life is someone breath it just means breathing awareness if you breathe with awareness if you breathe with awareness you soothe the nerves and calm the mind and when\n24:51 -

          "transcript": "00:00 - oh the only purpose of man sergeant on this earth is to seek God can you hear me all now can you all hear me okay now as you all know that I have not come here to give you a lecture or a talk\n00:20 - I've come here to know you and I am open to know you and you must in turn know me and this whole occasion let's jump out of the box it's not about lectures or talk or walk\n00:47 - the talk it's not about that celebrating life we are all here about celebrating life I celebrate life it's not about walk or lecture or talk or yoga or philosophy or Christianity or\n01:13 - humanity or it's about celebrating life everything comes in that and because of a lack of words in English I had to create a new word it is about celebrating soul fullness so today I'm\n01:33 - going to give you a celebration of soulfulness not only well I have to have the painful task of explaining to your soulfulness but I must give you a taste of soulfulness this is important I must\n01:45 - give you a tape I must give you a taste of soulfulness right so therefore the first half of my talk and my interaction with you would be to interact or us I'd like to interact with your aura you know\n02:02 - there's there's nothing is done unless the ice is broken at the the people here they are so intellectual so mindful there there's a new system of yogic training which they were not able\n02:17 - to explain which they are practicing it's called mindfulness so I completed the poetry the poem by saying mindfulness soulfulness and consciousness I will explain to you what\n02:31 - all three are then I will give you an experience the experience will be a transitory experience you will be transiting from mindfulness to soul fullness to consciousness I can you hear\n02:48 - me and I'd also like you to talk in between with me and interact and respond let's be something different than the painted walls let's react and respond and of course after that I'm going to\n03:02 - give you an opportunity to ask questions and clear your doubts all this celebrate of life and celebration of soulfulness is to get to to the state of practicing yoke through the new life awakening\n03:25 - movement we have this new life awakening movement to celebrate soulfulness and to form community is thereby to form gatherings whereby we can generate enough of soulful love to shatter the\n03:45 - hatred with the love we generate this is what we got to do this is the job don't worry about the pain in your foot because the world disciple is not a perfected word disciple we have a world\n03:59 - disciple the world disciple is a cosmic man semi cosmic man who has seven point six billion cells in its body which means the souls on this planet earth and the word disciple is collective humanity\n04:16 - is the world disciple have you understood I sew some portions of this collective humanity have got gangrene some have got a broken leg some have got emotional suffering leave it don't dwell\n04:31 - on the gangrene or the emotional suffering their souls dwell on the light dwell on celebrating soil fullness dwell on celebrating living ness this is what I'm here for\n04:46 - and to wake you and shake you up a little if I just talked I'll keep you bored like I'm saying all your faces are pretty serious and glump eyed my endeavours to make make the faces smile\n04:59 - and genuinely not from outwardly to show me but from the soul within from practicing soulfulness this is what is important so obviously when I'm having a sip I'm going to take a break\n05:25 - now let me explain to you this I have seen some people they throwing words around which is good which we are explaining what Yogi's in modern terminology I went to London had some\n05:45 - seminars and some sessions there and I found that this word mindfulness was very popular there and I asked a few people what it means but they could not tell me so I said I may as well create\n05:59 - my own meaning and may as well understand it in the sense of yoke since it is it is plucked out from the ancient background of yoke the unity humanity community humanity mindfulness is a very\n06:22 - profound state of mind the first state of mind if we start from concentration the practice of concentration would be as you focus on a particular object or a person your thoughts keep running away\n06:48 - from the focus the object of your focus before you can wrap your mind around that particular object or person there are ten other thoughts which come and distract that concentration I to\n07:03 - repeatedly bring back the stray thoughts to the focus of your attention to the object of your attention is called the practice of concentration I'm thinking let's say there's this picture of this\n07:19 - person this Gurunath he's there is by the United Nations and it's a beautiful picture I'm seeing the globe there and there he's standing there in the same old clothes which he's wearing now and\n07:33 - it's a very nice picture and then sir is somebody with the orange shirt comes I get distracted he's he's going to the corner and I don't know what he's doing there's another lady they've come late\n07:44 - this is distracted so I bring my distracted thought again I say okay let's get back to the man with a beard and he's got a wonderful beard he's standing before the UN symbol I wonder\n07:54 - did he speak the same subject at the United Nations or not and this thing and then some some lady's going with the bag again opening the door so again I pulled the thought back again I focus on the\n08:05 - object so this is a distracted mind and I'm concentrating I'm trying to cultivate the Faculty of exclusive attention upon that person the picture of that person as long as this pulling\n08:22 - these stray thoughts the vagabond thoughts as long as I keep them pulling back I am known to practice concentration the moment concentration is perfected and there's no distraction\n08:33 - no thoughts distracting and there's a constant flow there's an effortless flow towards the object which is the picture of Gurunath uninterrupted by any other thought or\n08:46 - any other distraction that is a flow a train of thoughts flowing only on to Gurunath and then your mind is full only of Gurunath that is a state of mindfulness have I explained this\n09:00 - mindfulness how many of you heard of this new technique it's a fad it's come out mindfulness raise your hands oh oh my god it's spread well why why and how how many explained it in this way it is\n09:14 - how many found this way better a good explanation to that raise your hands and a new explanation to that raise your hands okay it's obviously a new explanation I don't agree with you that\n09:26 - you knew this so because because I'm creating this so constant when when a rower is rowing a boat firstly he's distracted he doesn't get into rhythm his body gets into rhythm his oars are\n09:44 - clutched and then he gets into the same rhythm and there's nothing but he ho heave ho when he gets into that rhythm he is only focused on that rhythm the oars and he rowing that with effort\n10:01 - as long as there's effort in the rowing with the boatman and the ore that is called mindfulness that is called concentration when the oars and the rower become one the oars and the person\n10:14 - holding the oars they become one life they come fused into one that is called mindfulness right now there's another stage of soulfulness the mindfulness is when there is no distraction and is\n10:36 - rowing but when the boat the oars the boatman the boat and the oars they become one and there's no difference between them all are one he is the subject and the object become one the\n10:50 - boat the oars and the person rowing that is known as soulfulness soulfulness is when you're so intent on the object that it becomes one mindfulness soulfulness in mindfulness you are focusing on the\n11:11 - image and when you're perfectly in mindfulness and there's no distraction but it's only regarding the picture of Gurunath where does he come from who is he what did he talk at the United\n11:25 - Nations with no other hey get my coffee hey let's go to Trader Joe's and get some truffle Pia what are those latest fads which you guys have truffle almonds\n11:35 - who's that the truffle almonds many of you have known that has spread very wild and it's very good if you haven't tried it have it so you get those distraction of truffle diamonds when you don't get\n11:44 - those distractions and you're totally at one flow of thought one flow only regarding the Guru that one flow of thought who is he where's he from what does he teach that is mindfulness you\n11:57 - are not distracted that is mindfulness a ceaseless flow of thought without outer distraction is mindfulness soulfulness --is when he looked so much at the photo of Gurunath that the\n12:09 - subject the subject and the object become one there is no thought then I am him I'm experiencing him that is soulfulness that's a very high state of composed mind are you understanding what\n12:24 - I'm saying okay very high state of composed mind I'm I'm I'm actually speaking about the the the psychology of mystical awakening the psychology of spiritual awakening\n12:38 - then you get to a higher state of expansion which is known as consciousness when the mind leaves the object of Gurunath photo and Gurunath becoming one he leaves a relative object\n12:54 - he leaves relativity he leaves duality and goes into the singularity which is not focusing on the attributes or the physical body of the person nor the attributes of the person but just going\n13:11 - into his awareness his consciousness and both fusing at a higher level which is transcendence so mindfulness informs soulfulness transforms you into one right and consciousness is it is eminent\n13:34 - and is transcendent it is beyond the physical body beyond duality so when you go into consciousness there is no thought but both the souls of what the people meet here the body is meet in\n13:47 - soulfulness or the subtle body this intuitional body meets in soulfulness but the spiritual soul becomes one in consciousness so mindfulness soulfulness mindfulness soul\n14:01 - fullness and consciousness infinite have I explained this [Applause] since it's it's I'm speaking spontaneous its extempore it's very difficult for me\n14:22 - to choose the words you know enable to in order to enable you to understand it simply so thank you for your appreciation these are the three things which we have to learn and these are the\n14:39 - three things which we learn while practicing Kundalini Kriya yoga which is the later purpose of what I am going to teach you I'm going to initiate you into a simple practice it's easy anybody can\n14:55 - do it is easy it's meant for householders also the Kriya yoga which I am going to initiate you into tomorrow is a very simple method which takes you through these expanded states of\n15:09 - awareness and consciousness is the ecstasy of expanded awareness the ecstasy of expanded consciousness that is consciousness right we'll be giving you an experience of\n15:31 - these three states but I may take you through it very fast because you know it's like a clean and jerk when I pick up a bit if I do it slowly I may not pick you all up and take be able to pick\n15:42 - up your weight and take you all to that state by your weight I mean your mental luggage your your your the baggage that you have so my job is all 200-300 people here I have to remove their baggage\n15:56 - immediately and take them to the state of consciousness and make you experience what I experienced I otherwise how will you know what I experienced how do you know I'm not telling you a lie right\n16:06 - I of course you don't say that to others but you're putting me to the test which is good you must test the master so I will be taking you through these states very swiftly consecutively from\n16:27 - mindfulness to soulfulness to consciousness you may not notice it and land straight in consciousness and experiment start dissolving the unnecessary thoughts in your mind from\n16:43 - now because it's over an hour hence I will be giving you this for this please listen to me feelingly not thinking ly just sit and relax and absorb now the next question\n17:05 - this is it's fun it's simple and it's celebration celebrate life their souls celebrate life for there's so many things to cry about that you'll be crying your whole life let's not waste\n17:20 - time crying let's help to wipe the tear of another person but let us be so happiness in the happiness of others that we forget our own sorrow keep ourselves busy that's called serving\n17:35 - humanity as your large yourself which I here as a servant of humanity I'm doing serving you as my larger self now in this the new life awakening movement there are simple methods and\n18:01 - practices of breathing and postural integration which come under the category of yoga and there are certain patterns of breathing which take you to a tranquil state of mind they give you\n18:21 - peace of mind tranquility of mind so this tranquility is got by the practice of a simple science it is very simple I want to encourage all of you it's not a difficult thing it's meant for everybody\n18:40 - to practice the great masters gave this method of celebration so that the whole humanity could practice it it's free it's a religion free process free from any religion any denomination any cult\n18:57 - or any creed it's a way of life celebrating life is a way of life and a simple process of how this may be done what I will be giving tomorrow is very simple you sit in a comfortable\n19:15 - position a happy posture visualize your body to be the temple of the church and your breath the life to be celebrated your breath is the life to be celebrated which is called\n19:35 - the prana Oh cheap this word Chitty went from India and became Chi in China thousands of years later as it after most probably when hewing son came to India and he\n19:52 - discovered all these things he may have taken some yoke back with him and this is a process of simple breathing celebrating the breath celebrating the life of breath I may also celebrate that\n20:08 - with you and breathe through your breathing let's see how the time permits us let's see how time permits us most probably after the break I'll get to the experience part of it so this is a\n20:21 - process where you sit down visualize your body to be the sacred vortex of energy and move your breath gently in the manner which we tell you the practice of Kriya the practice of Kriya\n20:39 - yoga is very simple it depends upon to bodily currents one is the pranic current which ascends from the root the base of the spine up the spinal cord to the third eye the point\n20:58 - between the eyebrows the pranic current which rises is smooth and evolutionary and rejuvenating in its effect then from here you breathe down that is called the upon ik current which burns all\n21:21 - negativity it throws out and detoxes the whole system so this process of breathing does two things at the physical level and at the spiritual level at the physical level I call the\n21:33 - Kundalini Kriya yoga I call the rejuven detox technique it reads you the upward breath rejuvenates your body cells with fresh life and vigor and the downward breath detoxifies all the carbons you\n21:50 - see the body is carbon-based and the idea for longevity is to detox the body it alkaline and live longer in a nutshell so it's a rejuven detox technique at the physical level at the\n22:03 - spiritual level the pranic current which flows up the spine it expands consciousness the ecstasy of expanded consciousness it gives and the downward breath spiritually burns your past evil\n22:16 - karma and all negativity you practice it and you will see yourself to be a changed person I vouch and I guarantee for this the people who have been practicing with me and to thousands of\n22:28 - people I have served in all humility to transform their body their minds and their soulfulness to be more amenable and more fusible and more related and one with consciousness so this depends\n22:46 - upon the two breaths it's very simple everybody can do it it is meant for you it is your birthright that's why it's not a religion or a Creed it is a way of life it helps you to do what you're\n22:58 - already doing better a good Catholic would become a better Catholic we're not taking away a good Jew which become a better joke better Jo means really a better Jew a better and a good se Hindu\n23:16 - or good person from Islam or any other denomination would can follow their their own part this way of life helps you to do what you're doing better since it is to do with a vital breath it is so\n23:31 - relevant you're they're so relevant to your life that without it you cannot breathe and if you cannot breathe you cannot live it's not relevant to your life it is\n23:41 - your life but you are breathing scientifically thereby resting the heart and when you rest the heart ageing wear-and-tear is diminished if you rest the body by superior means if you take\n23:55 - fresh oxygen by the scientific process of pranayama okay pranayama then you will be able to rest your body parts and prolong life not only prolongation of life will\n24:12 - happen but the quality of your life will increase the quality of your life will increase so this is a simple science and I would really this this way of life is very encouraging because seeing the\n24:26 - world situation today the world condition man in the world condition the human being in today's world condition somehow cannot control everything which he thought he could and at certain times\n24:41 - he's helpless so therefore take the help of a superior reality let not the ego come in the way there are superior realities they are vast\n24:56 - greater and deeper realities than us who can really come to our health and save this earth from the critical state of being blown up by the super super massive volcano which is the berserk and\n25:14 - the aberrant temperament of the human being himself so therefore humanity to live in peaceful coexistence needs to practice a technique which a way of life which will\n25:30 - bring peace and order in his own life which will bring earth peace through self peace so this is a humble appeal to you and also a humble push from the behind if you're reluctant I'll push you\n25:47 - with my breath just you know like the mother Swan pushes the the cygnets the bay the baby swans into the water for the first time she comes along and some of them I had hesitant she just pushes\n25:57 - them with a wing and then they all automatically start swimming so so easy is Kriya yoga like the little baby swans you will soon start swimming in the waters of life and living nests and then\n26:09 -

          "transcript": "00:07 - and know the silence and the peace that is the core of our being about indweller residing in each one of you and I pray that we all know that at the\n00:58 - level of consciousness humanity is one we are one community one family and one being may the divine inspires to realize this truth and as I begin today's today's gathering with you I know and I\n01:45 - feel that this is a family gathering it is not a gathering of foreigners or visitors or aliens it's a gathering of our own people who breathe the same breath because we are all connected by\n02:07 - the same breath today's get together it's a gathering to realize that we are all connected by the same breath today's get-together is not merely a\n02:26 - talk which I will give you of course I will tell you a few things there will be question answers but above all today's gathering today's satsang I would like to make an experiential one experiential\n02:48 - because we have to get out of the dead letter into the living spirit that you all represent you're not this house of flesh and bone which sleeps decays and dies your immortal consciousness Lord of\n03:08 - the earth and the skies they have to make the shift shift your identity from the corruptible body to the immortal soul this is the message I bring you the shift the paradigm shift you have to\n03:25 - realize that you are not a perishable body but an everlasting immortal consciousness and it is towards this realization that I present to you the practice of the science of Kriya yoga\n03:43 - which I will discuss and I will tell you about as we go along today's satsangh now before I begin I'd like I would like to see my audience somebody has put off all the lights and just blasted me with\n03:59 - the lights so so I cannot see one talking to I don't know who's made the light arrangements may I request there you go it should be a fair deal you know it's not that you are sitting in the\n04:12 - dark and as I need to see your angelic faces to all potential angels potential gods I can see it because I could look deep you cannot see yourselves as gods in angels but I can see yourself\n04:31 - and angels because I see with the consciousness and the divine I in the day-to-day life people contact one another and see one another through the eyes of the flesh but if you look with\n04:49 - the eyes of the Spirit and a still mind you will see the dazzlings sold the dazzling consciousness inherent in every one of you there is so much hope I do not come here to teach you any religious\n05:07 - cult or Creed I come here to unite with you as brothers and sisters and friends as a community as a family and as one being and when I breathe through your breath\n05:21 - you will realize that my breath is connected to your breath and therefore if our breath is connected all together why should we not as we breathe the same breath have the same consciousness have\n05:34 - the same super-soul we are all one but as much as I may talk you will you will understand it intellectually you will agree to it and you'll be happy that I'm saying this but you will not believe it\n05:50 - from the innermost core unless you get the experience so that is very necessary and for you to get the experience please drop all preconceived notions I forgot to put that notice outside as you\n06:06 - entered leave all preconceived notions and the negative mind outside the door with your slippers and shoes and come in clean and pure like a child a child of five they're ready to learn ready to\n06:24 - experience I do not know whether they've told you before I came that when because this today's satsangh is experiential you should drop the mind and open the heart and let the light in love pour\n06:38 - through because if you want an experience then there must be no attitude attitude is an aberration of the mind the twisted mind\n06:56 - so therefore if your simple and filled with your head and think with your heart then all will be well because you will be well balanced it's a good idea I have come to give you this message from the\n07:20 - ancient hills and mountains of the Himalayas that there is an ancient science as old as the hills it is a lost science it has nothing got to do with the seventh-day adventists or the year\n07:40 - Hovis witnesses or Christianity or Hinduism or Islam it has got to do with you it's got to do with you with a clear mind as you had when you were 2 2 years of age but then all these things these\n08:00 - layers of mind came upon you but you're not healthy for the world citizen we are world citizens and we can't get along with our neighbors and in my humble understanding there have been all these\n08:25 - denominations and philosophies and ideologies and religions in the world and I like them all and I bow to them all and I respect them all but our endeavour and my I always asked myself\n08:47 - this question that yes definitely these great religions are there but then why have they not being able to bring the people of this earth to live in peaceful coexistence\n09:11 - the observation is that they have not so therefore I have evolved it is I do not know how to put it there's no ayat but a certain idea grew in me not to say that this would be successful or unsuccessful\n09:31 - we don't know but we can all try it if human beings were human beings and cut off stripped themselves off of their ideologies and religious trappings and became human beings first then we could\n09:55 - stay together in peaceful coexistence therefore I always said that humanity if earth peace is to herald the dawn of the new age we must all realize that humanity is a Uniting religion I said\n10:22 - this at the United Nations I was invited to speak over there and I said what what saying do you have what is your soul cried they don't have any because they're too busy settling wars in the\n10:33 - Middle East and with you know Syria and they torn with all these bickerings and battles and Wars and I said humanity is are uniting religion let's let's make this our breath our motto let's make it\n10:51 - our vision humanity are uniting religion breath are uniting prayer if today I try and force you to say our Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth\n11:10 - as it is in heaven give us this day our trespasses and all so once I say no sir I don't have that prayer my prayers better you know he'll say I am Islam and I say la ilaha illallah muhammadur\n11:24 - rasulu la la la another fellow say no no I don't like that I say jai Rama Sri Rama JJ Rob jai Rama Sri Rama JJ no no no hail Mary full of grace so we want to have such a prayer\n11:41 - where we don't clash with one another and what is that prayer let's simplify it to its ultimate it's your breath that's the only thing humanity can do as a religion without stepping on the toes\n11:55 - of one another without offending one another and without hurting one another's feelings because you're already breathing I was educated in an English public school and we had very\n12:08 - fine prayers and the missionaries left no stone unturned to make us good Catholics or good Christians I did I became but I was still thirsty for more so I\n12:20 - went to Islam I studied there is I became an a Muslim but that didn't satisfy be a mentor Zoroastrianism instead went to Christianity I went to Havas witnesses I went to Hinduism but I\n12:35 - was still thirsty and then I said the path is to find the true nature with him without these religious ideologies or trappings let the mind fly free you see the religion means to bind to one\n12:47 - ideology or one philosophy it's a Greek word meaning religion religion religion to bind we don't want to bind we want to fly we don't want religion we want Union yoga the Union within soul with the\n13:03 - spirit we want the union with the soul of the soul with the spirit so therefore I went and my parents used to tell me go to the temple and this and that and all it's very necessary and God you know he\n13:19 - gives you his your bread and butter he gives you life he gives you love so go to the temple be holy be good I said that's good do charities one day I didn't go to the temple and I didn't go\n13:32 - for three days God gives me life but I didn't go for three days but I nothing happened I was still as good as I was and I didn't die then I same thing I tried with a with the mosque I used to\n13:46 - go to the mosque in the dargah I did a lot of practices of Islam in which I reveled and enjoyed myself I didn't go to the mosque the Masjid of the Ramadan nothing happened I didn't die I had\n14:01 - Christianity I didn't go to church for three days God didn't punish me I didn't die then I tried to hold my breath for three minutes\n14:10 - I said witches and I almost died so I said this is my humanity are uniting religion breath is our uniting prayer breath is the prayer without which without praying the breath I will surely\n14:31 - die and therefore Kriya yoga is the science of the breath it is not Hindu Christian Muslim or any other religious denomination it is a scientific path of selfing into the self\n14:45 - the answer lies within dear Souls the answer lies within no God from anywhere no teacher nobody can give you we can just guide you but the answer you have to find for yourself and the answer does\n14:58 - not lie in dabbling in the intellectual mind and getting analysis paralysis the answer lies in stilling the mind and behind the rough and tumble of the daily mind you see the still consciousness so\n15:13 - you have to look within and this is the technique of yoga which satisfies all your queries humanity are uniting religion breath are uniting prayer and consciousness are uniting God this is\n15:32 - the same at all the United Nations put it up they should be the model of the world's motto because I know we have a very small religion they say Islam is the biggest Christianity is the biggest\n15:43 - I say ours is the humblest so how many people does your religion have so many 50 to 52 countries 62 countries I said we have humanity and those who follow humanity means need not follow religious\n15:57 - trappings of course respect them we respect each one of your religions we respect each one of your Creed's each one of your philosophies but over and above that please humanities Everth\n16:11 - pieces to herald the dawn of the new age let us all realize that humanity is our uniting religion say after me if earth peace is to herald the dawn of the new age\n16:30 - everybody said let us all realize humanity are uniting religion breath are uniting prayer and consciousness are uniting God close your eyes inhale and see how you feel about it\n17:03 - inhale love hold love and exhale love for earth peace and hail love for self peace hold love exhale enough for earth peace inhale love for self peace hold exhale love for earth peace\n17:45 - inhale for selfies hold that it mixed with every atom of your being makes a love for that piece okay open your eyes so here we are on the same platform on\n18:18 - the same page with a clean slate but we're human beings we breathe and we have a divine essence within us a consciousness it's very basic that's all we need\n18:37 - that's all we need to find our divine indweller to find the God within us that's all we must live with awareness and this is the message I bring from the Himalayan\n18:55 - Yogi's this is a lifestyle it's a way of life and this life style of yoga which I'm going to teach you and empower you tomorrow into the science of Kriya yoga will see you through your bridge shall\n19:17 - not break the rainbow bridge between humanity and divinity is the science of Kriya yoga it is not a cult nor Creed it is totally nondenominational it contradicts no religion faith or creed\n19:37 - but complements all it contradicts none of your lifestyle but helps you do what you're already doing better and for this practice and see for yourself that's what I'm going to give you tomorrow this\n19:57 - practice it is a pathway to peace and self-realization the practice of this yoke is a simple spinal breathing where you focus your consciousness your soul consciousness you focus it in your spine\n20:18 - and you do spinal breathing and you will be if you practice one of the known heroes of humanity Victor of depth B breath enthralled if you are enthralled in your breath now what does\n20:50 - this science of Kriya yoga do what does it do exactly and why should I you know leave my prayer and my Christianity or mine Amma's of Islam and practice Kriya you know I'm not saying leave it do it\n21:06 - follow your own faith do what you like do what you think is like but listen to me as well over and above what you do practice the scientific technique because I will tell you that your body\n21:23 - everybody here is carbon-based your physical body is carbon-based it's made of carbon the atoms and molecules of carbons now everybody here I see is going into veganism vegetarianism Caesar\n21:40 - salad not with the blue dressing but the Italian dressing because it has less weight in it no blue cheese they're very very particular especially the ladies the men are little careless but the\n21:52 - ladies lead them on the super health diet so it's so you ask the ladies they say what are you doing we're detoxing we think they're always detoxing but they say they say yogi your face is shining\n22:07 - and you look pretty you have got a white beard and a young face and a white beard how come so how's your face so young in a beard so white I said I also detox so that time that lady who asked me this\n22:23 - question was in Hawaii and she was saying I'm very very interested but she was having a soul repair she was mending her soles of her feet and only toenails and all that she was in the spa and had\n22:37 - a feet and she was getting her feet pampered whatever you call that okay now a pedicure so I saw I said ten minutes it carried on 20 minutes again on half an hour 45 minutes one hour so then I\n22:57 - couldn't control myself and I went up to this great lady I said if she's spending so much time on her feet how much time she must be spending on her head she seems to have more feet than in her head\n23:13 - so anyway I kept my opinions to myself and I said I told her one day I said look I said madam I'd like to tell you one thing it's a very simple scientific thing I said if you spent half the time\n23:32 - if you spent half the time you spend on your souls on your soul you would be liberated by now so she said what do you mean I said exactly what I'm saying you have pampered the soles of your feet for\n23:52 - one hour plus you know getting in scrubbed and dubbed and rosewater and this El Cap cactus juice and mango juice and almond paste and whatnot and all I learnt a lot when I when I come here to\n24:05 - America I learn a lot of these things or detox material and it's terrific so so I also enjoy some of these things so she said I said look if you meditate on your inner consciousness on your soul\n24:28 - for even half an eye every day with such passion that you are curing your or pedicure in your feet you will definitely get to a deep state of realization\n24:43 - so she but very interested and she started questioning and then later on she came and took the Kriya yoga and she is progressing when still practicing and all those little aches and pains and she\n24:57 - said I don't go to the spa but my my friends tell me that my face is glowing so I said madam tell your friends I didn't mean to put them out of business but they can carry on their spa but if\n25:11 - you detox your body regularly if your breathing oh three in your spine there's an atomic explosion which takes place in the spine and you are breathing the long breath if you notice that the slower the\n25:30 - person breathes the longer he lives if you see a human being he lives for sixty to eighty years he's breathing about what sixty top 30 times Oh twenty-two times per minute I don't know\n25:47 - whatever it is he breathes twenty one thousand six hundred times in 24 hours so he lives for sixty to eight years if you see an elephant is breathing only sixteen times he lives well over a\n25:60 - hundred years the elephant unless it's killed by accident well over 100 years then if you see a giant tortoise or turtle he breathes four breaths a minute and we have been known to have Turtles\n26:15 - which are living for 400 years am i right turtle said so the fella the the observation of the Yogi's was to slow the breath and Lane in the life but as you slow the breath\n26:28 - it cuts through the carbon the toxins the negativity of the mind simple breathing breathing with awareness dissolves emotional suffering it alleviates mental stress it soothes the\n26:48 - nerves and calms the mind this you will practice and see for yourself it's a science the human heart is doing about 18 to 20 tons of work with the blood every 24 hours which is a great strain\n27:07 - on the heart and the system now if by superior means of lengthened breathing I oxygenate my cells my body cells and keep them in a spiritually magnetized condition all my alveoli are fresh and\n27:25 - full of oxygen normally we are breathing with how much percent of our lungs 16% 20% 30% 40% athletes 60 to 70% 80% even but the normal person using 17 to 25 percent he never breathes deeply so I\n27:48 - wanted to remind the people in America that it was not Jane Fonda who started the aerobic system of breathing 10,000 years ago we people knew about the science of pranayama and we also knew of\n28:04 - the science of Cheeta Cheeta means the life force energy which the Chinese reversed and made Tai Chi Chi Tai I know by now you know everything is coming from India it's a beacon of light to the\n28:19 - world it so happened like other countries have their specialities one has politics America has business they Germany has mechanics they are all expert so India has spirituality as it's\n28:32 - been to mind so when you when you breathe longer your body is filled with oxygen and your cells are kept in a spiritually magnetized condition and therefore the\n28:44 - pumping of the heart is slower from 20 18 tons to 14 tons to 6 tons to 3 tons work to 110 to 300 pounds and when you steal the heart and I on am spiritually magnetized condition of Samadhi the\n29:01 - blissful state of expanded consciousness your heart is still you need not breathe the pulse is not beating the heart is not beating because you have enough reservoir of life force within you to\n29:16 - rest the heart and yet live on that's called Samadhi the state of Samadhi state of trance which is the true Yoga Yoga is not putting your your feet on your head that is just physical postures\n29:34 - the true yoga has Samadhi obvious Satori and all these zen and all are a small portion it trickled from india and went to japan and china and that you think to be the true meditation but the true\n29:46 - meditation is yo now when you oxygenate your body and fulfill it you get longitude of life and a constant breathing also detoxifies the body alleviates emotional suffering decreases\n30:04 - and dissolves stress of the day-to-day life resulting in a still mind and when the ripples of thought in your mind's lake are still then only you can see the moon\n30:20 - of your delight I the moon of your delight is what your soul your divine indweller the Christ within the Krishna within the Babaji within that is the main thing so\n30:36 - you have to practice this technique in everyday you need not be a believer in God you need not be a non believer in God you can practice it scientifically and still get the results\n30:49 - you will be you but you will be pure your aura you're radiant shall shine and those of you many of you who have come here all those who have come here you have already crossed the first stage\n31:04 - because you have come here otherwise who's gonna come and listen to a madman we have so many things here we have the beach we have Disneyland we have the best of scotches and wines and figures\n31:18 - and fries and trees and a holiday resort and why should they spend time because you are evolved you want something deeper you have had enough of the superfluous things of life and then you\n31:32 - say to yourself never take things by the outward show although I know America is all about packaging I agreed he says never take things by the outward show for the feather flies high but the Pearl\n31:49 - lies low this is important and I have explained to you now basically the science of Kriya yoga and I will be teaching this tomorrow the Kriya yoga is of course to be practiced\n32:13 - it's a scientific technique all great masters have practiced to this or that effect the science of breath",

          "transcript": "00:16 - is the supreme guru of all gurus the sacrament of all sacraments the supreme guru of all guru the king of kings the lord of lords the damnedest the nameless one\n00:31 - the guru and the disciple are here together on this auspicious occasion of guru purnima what is the nature\n00:53 - of the fabric of nature and how the master helps the disciple or in some cases like this one he does it all for the disciple\n01:08 - to reveal to him the pure consciousness the non-being essentiality as i call it god is a non-being essentiality it\n01:23 - doesn't matter because he is not a matter and he is so way beyond our comprehension he is so way beyond that we can just who\n01:34 - are thou i know thee not and yet i am of thee i cannot comprehend the lord thou emperor of divinity so what do i do complete the verse so\n01:48 - i sit and melt i sit and melt in silence of thy love or infinity make me thy truth\n01:58 - make me thy love eternal lord of life this is the prayer of the devotee but the person of knowledge the gyan yogi like the bhapta yogi tries in his own\n02:09 - way and the rajyogi explains in his own way the fabric of nature we are all veiled this whole creation\n02:29 - from the molecules atoms electrons protons and neutrons they compose the whole of creation\n02:40 - but they are in a constant state of flux in a constant state of motion nothing is still in creation not even stillness is still\n02:55 - not even not even let us see this phrase you think that this is still no it's in constant motion\n03:05 - very very very microscopic motion so the whole of creation the whole of creation is in motion it's a wave nothing is still\n03:17 - so the fabric of creation is motion from the densest metal to light itself are all in motion\n03:31 - of varying frequencies various cycles per second various vibrations but they are all motion\n03:48 - the fabric of creation molecules then they divide themselves they later get atoms then you get to the subatomic level you know sometimes when i meditate with you and i get to\n04:02 - the subatomic level and you are looking at me my face disappears and you can only feel my peace i\n04:11 - raise your hands the people outside the country who have felt this very good very good i'm talking about the fabric of\n04:22 - maya what the whale of nature is made of what the whole creation is made of so it is made of molecules the molecules subdivide themselves into atoms atoms\n04:35 - become subtler and divide themselves into electron protons and neutrons which are known as the three gunas electrons protons and neutrons\n04:48 - then they all merge into the single electron which becomes the undifferentiated fabric of light\n04:57 - light becomes a lifeless light and lightless light becomes consciousness now we are talking about how the fabric of creation is formed how the fabric of creation is formed\n05:12 - so now this whole world there is a veil which separates the cosmic energy pradhan for\n05:22 - undifferentiated homogeneous energy which in science is called the protile or maybe we call it\n05:34 - pradhan mula prakruti what is the composition of the moon prakruti what is the basic format of nature\n05:45 - after which it cannot be reduced into any simpler composition what is the basic substance of nature i am talking about\n05:59 - the basic substance of nature the basic format of nature now pay attention here pay attention here nature\n06:11 - the basic format of nature is like a net of space and time i will tell you the formation of the net of the basic veil of maya\n06:23 - the basic veil of avidya which covers our site a particle the minimum distance traveled by a particle\n06:38 - the distance traveled by a particle from the shortest distance traveled by a particle from one point\n06:51 - to another in the shortest possible time got it i the shortest distance traveled by a particle\n07:03 - in the shortest possible time after which no further division can take place and forms a space\n07:15 - time frame this is a called a space time frame the shortest distance traveled by a particle in the shortest possible trial is one one space time frame\n07:28 - zillions of space times frame form what is called the veil of the fabric of nature this is what the fabric ladies you know what a fabric is\n07:40 - okay ladies ultimate fabric of nature is what you wear which is your clothes your body the ultimate fabric of nature the shortest possible\n07:54 - distance traveled by a photon in the shortest possible time is one space time frame many such speed and which cannot be\n08:04 - further divided this is a space time frame of the shortest electron or the shortest possible distance in the shortest possible time one photon traveling in the shortest\n08:15 - possible distance in the shortest possible time many such time frames form the fabric of creation form the veil of maya i is that clear have i clarified myself any questions\n08:35 - very nice simple question she has asked are there any spaces or cracks between those spaces this is a you know so that is there\n08:49 - that there are there are space the shortest possible distance traveled in the shortest possible time so there should be nothing in between\n09:00 - there should be nothing in between but there is another fabric behind it shiva also wears a fabric although he is known as with no clothes\n09:11 - prakruti has the clothes shiva is without clothes i [Music] there's another fabric this fabric of\n09:18 - maya we're talking about the shortest possible distance traveled at the shortest possible time by the photon after which no further division can take\n09:29 - place i there is a fabric so what does now we have to penetrate this fabric we have to go because unless you go\n09:39 - beyond the fabric there is consciousness but you cannot see the consciousness because these small movements of electron protons and neutrons photons\n09:50 - are traveling at the shortest possible distance in the shortest possible time they're not giving us time nor space to see the veil behind it this is the great whale of maya\n10:03 - this is prakriti the mole of prakruti this is what they call the great delusion the great veil and this is the whale that ultimately helps us to get to god\n10:13 - to get to the supreme business of the zero not zero so guru not is here he wants to get you\n10:23 - beyond this veil even though it be temporarily even though it be temporarily which he does not all the time\n10:34 - so now there's a space behind this behind this movement is consciousness pure awareness there is no travel\n10:45 - there is no travel of any photon or particle in the shortest path from one distance to another in the shortest possible time\n10:57 - the shortest possible space there is no travel we don't know what that shortest possible time in shortest possible spaces\n11:07 - that shortest possible time in shortest possible space is beyond the new numbers of the human mind or it may be as i would tell you the shortest\n11:19 - possible space and shortest possible time i will give you a hint light travels at 300 000 miles per second so nothing can be faster than 300\n11:30 - 000 miles per second anything which is faster than 300 000 miles per second the fabric of maya melts i\n11:40 - do you understand got it so the so that the question is is it possible traveling\n11:57 - the shortest possible distance in the shortest possible time what guru nanak does is make you travel no distance in no time that is the gap\n12:12 - that is that this is all guru please start from a book it's coming out guru purnima from you from my last experience my past life experience so the only thing which is\n12:22 - only this the only space time frame which is smaller than the the shortest possible distance in the shortest possible time is the\n12:32 - time frame of no distance in no time experience of the hamsa still makes one no divinity's win will in the here now truth alive the now the now i\n12:53 - so they say i'm trying to i'm a master i'm not a teacher i'm trying to be a good teacher they say a good teacher is one who takes the most difficult topics and makes them simple\n13:02 - am i am i being partially successful as a teacher all the hamsa charities and creators okay so now what garuna does\n13:17 - he takes you to a place what is the place what is the poetry he said no space in no time the space time\n13:31 - continuum that is the space time continuum okay that is broken down here there's the issues of zero not zero that is faster than that\n13:51 - space time frame is so it says there is no time place country no thought no desire no nothing over\n14:01 - there there is no space there is no time continuum everything is not even god is the not being essentiality even god\n14:15 - has a center everywhere circumference nowhere because he travels in no time no space in no time he is this is the answer and when guru nanak takes you to the\n14:28 - state of no mind when guru nanak takes you to the state of samadhi the nirvikalpa for the state of the shiva path the thought-free state of awareness\n14:43 - he does not take you to the nose no time no space continuum be very careful i hope you are recording this when guru nanak takes you there are two\n14:59 - things he takes you into when shiva path and i'm splitting here now i'm splitting the electron the first state it takes you is in a\n15:09 - state of a thought-free state of awareness that is the state of i am-ness all this is being this is an eek this is a molten lake\n15:24 - of one mind but it is still divine mind it is not divine consciousness and one state of thought free of energy takes you is in divine mind the state of all of this is me\n15:36 - i am there the background of mind is always there that means in this space it is so fast one space time frame after another that it appears to be one motion picture one\n15:50 - motion one picture because if this state is called nirvichar samadhi the thought free state of samadhi i take you in shiva path and no mind state i but guru natal is himself\n16:05 - is not a nirvich samadhi himself is in the integrated state of nirvikalpa samadhi if he were nirvijay would not be able to do anything he has to come down to derby\n16:18 - to project so in the what is the quality of thought uh which i give you as a thoughtful\n16:27 - state what is the fabric of thought the fabric of thought is interwoven with small electrons it is interwoven the the time the shortest possible\n16:40 - distance an electron takes to travel from one point in space in the shortest possible time is one space time electron this is the state of nirvichar samadhi you are in a state of\n16:55 - undifferentiated mind one mind so it feels that you are in a state of consciousness you feel you are in a state of thought-free awareness\n17:05 - but but the basic substance of mind is still there with supporting your thought-free state the mind stuff\n17:17 - is made of the one electron this is the state of samadhi or a smith samadhi where everything where the homogeneous your homogeneous awareness is in the birds\n17:29 - the bees the flowers the trees the skies the ocean every atom of creation all is one all is you i am-ness that is also the state of the prash which i take you so this is one state of\n17:43 - thought-free awareness where you see god but you see him through a very very very very thin veil of maya a very very thin veil of the electron\n17:60 - this is very very important that there is another subtler state where the electron shifts to become light there also\n18:13 - the photon is traveling not the electron that is light the shortest possible distance traveled by one photon from one place to another in the shortest possible time photon is\n18:23 - the smallest particle in life so it's not an electron it's one mile faster than electron it's light pure knife forms the homogeneous fabric of maya the homogeneous fabric of creation\n18:35 - one space type frame of light not exceeded light so that is the second phase\n18:45 - in and beyond nebuchadner right up to that the light mind is right up to dharma make samadhi that is the second fabric of the mind the first is composed of the electron\n18:56 - the subtler one is of pure light and then when you go into the lightness light when you go beyond light that is in dharma make samadhi the fabric of maya the fabric of prakruti the fabric\n19:08 - of creation becomes subtler and subtler and subtler till in that final state of god awareness this\n19:21 - light also melts and then the final wheel of light the final veil of prakruti the final veil of fires cast aside\n19:33 - burning any other residues and then you see yourself in pure consciousness this nobody is able to give anyone you have to get there to yourself the\n19:44 - ultimate finale but through the state of subtle mind through the pure mind which is known as the divine mind you can see a pure awareness\n19:55 - this is what guru nanak does when he gives you these are three states the final state also has to be crossed by you into the lightness life which is pure awareness i all those who have\n20:07 - understood is this enough food for thought lifelong i so now getting to the third state\n20:20 - there is a silence behind the silence behind which there is another nothingness a silence it's all a question of\n20:31 - the evolution and the purity of your mind how much in depth you go into the consciousness how much in depth you go to the\n20:40 - consciousness this is very very important so guru natal gives you what is called what does he give you he gives you the desireless state\n20:56 - of total satisfaction have you ever heard of a desireless state setting satisfying your material desires if you have material desires if you want a ferrari you go and buy it and you get\n21:09 - notice if you're satisfied you want a ferrari and you go into the still state and it can't be satisfied but this is the uniqueness of the sadhguru all satgurus will give you a desireless\n21:20 - state of total satisfaction you will say how is this how can you give a desire to stay because desire has got to do with the desire of the senses\n21:32 - desire of sight taste touch smell feeling greed lust sex happiness joy compassion these went fulfilled you get satiated your desire is\n21:46 - fulfilled stay you are totally satisfied when the objects of your senses are achieved by you and satisfied but guru nanak gives you a still state\n22:05 - the no mind state or better the thought-free state of divine awareness maybe it is through divine mind but it's\n22:21 - still awareness awareness can still give us experience in divine mind and awareness can be of divine consciousness also but the awareness is of the nature of\n22:33 - divine consciousness therefore you are getting a feeling of shiva an experience of shiva when your mind is still even in a state of nerve samadhi so now when he gives you this thought\n22:52 - free state he waves his hand and your thoughts disappear and you are still and as you go\n23:09 - you feel it couldn't get better this is it this is guru nanak guru natal\n23:23 - is giving me himself as the stillness as the peace what is the nature of guru nanak\n23:33 - total satisfaction this is it what does guru not feel like when you drink a glass a bottle of guru nanak i have quenched the thirst of the ages i\n23:47 - how many feel this is a good description this is the one i want the hell i care for the world they may call him satan they may call him god i don't care\n24:06 - i have quenched the thirst of the ages i've reached home how many get this feeling raise your hands this is it\n24:20 - it couldn't get better this is it it couldn't get better this is now what is the substance this is not of mind this is not a mind this is god this is\n24:35 - consciousness which the guru gives to you that is the litmus test of the satguru this is it i have reached home\n24:46 - guru not you have quenched the thirst of the ages remember these words this is it i have reached home the satguru has fetched the thirst of\n24:56 - the ages but some days you may get more of this feeding and other days less that is not me calling shot me\n25:08 - your mind is disturbed and brought a thicker filter your mind has got the filter i said let me analyze your mind let's talk about the mind let's talk what guru nanak does\n25:20 - so guru nanak is he is that thought-free state of awareness which makes you feel you have quenched the thirst of the ages this is it i have reached home the point\n25:36 - that guru nanak is when you offer guru not why be very very i don't want some people to get restless anything they do it out of love that's large\n25:49 - but guru nanak has mine and he's offering this to you of course you don't treat it as wine you treat it as god you treat it as something sacred\n25:58 - so the quality of the fabric of guru nanak the essence of the quality is guru not you have quenched the thirst of the edges\n26:07 - this is it i have reached home it wouldn't get better if you get all these feelings then i'm totally merged in you\n26:18 - the blessings of the satguru are totally upon you i so this is what the guru does when he comes\n26:26 - now his presence of nothingness comes in front of the space-time phenomenon the fabric\n26:42 - so when the continuum when the consciousness faces the continuum i am the consciousness the continuum is the fabric of nature so when guru natal faces you who are the fabric of nature\n26:56 - he brings your shortest the distance traveled by your photon from one point to another in the shortest possible time\n27:08 - when guru nanak consciousness comes in front of you it transforms it from no time to no space\n27:17 - no minimum distance traveled from one point in space to the other in the shortest possible time is no time traveled\n27:27 - in no space traveled in no time in no distance and that is the state he gives you of the now now whether that now guru not gives you\n27:38 - a seat by you through the nirvijan samadhi of divine mind or of the divine consciousness is up to your spiritual evolution but he keeps thinning you away he keeps\n27:51 - using the rolling pill the abrasion of the rolling pillar pin on your mind stuff till it gets thinner and thinner and thinner till it vanishes into no mind\n28:04 - this is the explanation this is the difference between reading the patanjali yoga sutras which i honor very much and listening actually to a\n28:12 - guru because when you listen to the sakura he is not only theorizing that he is actually still your mind\n28:20 - he's actually giving you that the divine the nectar i haven't come to that yet i'll be having a small meditation so this is what it does when when the\n28:29 - consciousness stands in front of mullah property the divine consciousness the representative of whom is the sadhguru then that space-time continuum melts\n28:39 - into the now i raise your hands if you've understood okay now what we will do\n28:53 - the next phase i'm sorry i get so intense no space for you at all the smallest possible distance traveled to the shortest possible time\n29:03 - after which no further division can take place except no time no space\n29:10 - now everywhere no one at the same time shiva is everywhere shiva is nowhere shiva is now here\n29:25 - but it's very difficult for us to leave our material things we can't leave our handbag we clutch the handbag as a matter of fact the ladies have called one handbag\n29:37 - they call it the clutch i said what's the i looked at my left foot because that's where the clutch is in the in the shift drives the clutch so i said which class\n29:46 - they said no no they're closed ladies at the back they said this the clutch got some big little bag with golden filigree so that is the clutch right\n29:55 - you have to squeeze and release it right you see ninety percent of the gateway you go through the tests the efferent affirmative tests\n30:07 - in the laboratory in america is a laboratory right or laboratory i'll say the monetary you go to the ethere effort test in the laboratory and everything should be measured\n30:20 - from the molecule to the atom to the electron proton neutron beyond which you go no time no space then you must take the help of what is called the technique\n30:31 - of samadhi the techniques of samadhi is so you see these perceptions and you recognize this through a deep state of awareness only awareness can\n31:07 - cognize the subtlest matter so you take a help of this scientists have already gone far you know\n31:17 - they they've spoken about the space type continuum they've spoken about the electron the photon and this is how they've got to it and we also\n31:28 - we get to this by meditation i know not only get to this by meditation and speak on this i give the experience\n31:37 - so this is why guru nanak's words are important and it will always be that he will have a small you know\n31:47 - i don't know this may be because this turnout is because of the forward but otherwise these are things which are satellite which are more advanced\n31:55 - they're going to try to see whether they find it in the books and they'll be very happy to see that this this explanation is not found in the books because their guru is a\n32:03 - genuine guru the guru partner the grace of the guru has awakened in me and has awakened the eyes of my soul why is this song dear to us it may not\n32:32 - be the best hymn or the best spiritual prayer but your guru has composed the words the lyrics of this song as well as made the tube",

          "transcript": "practice this much\n01:19:12 - told get the results get the results and find out step on the scientific path technological y of and realize for yourself I never talk about God even I said I didn't say I'm\n01:19:24 - holy man and great God no I exist I'm not giving anyil so I'm an\n01:19:37 - existentialist is that fair enough I and my ambition was to seek reality which I have realized so I am an existential realist\n01:20:05 - he is known as the Supreme reality whatever you may call him Allah God the fact is that this is the Supreme\n01:20:24 - reality the naked Singularity Quantum physic calls it the naked so this reality because enough of these westerners making F fun of us and\n01:20:45 - say the Hindus have 33 billion gods and these Hindus are Blind Faith Believers not we are not we don't even believe in God and I said what are you guys talking about\n01:20:55 - what I'm talking about I'm walking I talk about the breath I breathe through your breath I tell you to do the technique of su yog I show you the Sun in the sky this is our\n01:21:07 - first his Sonu fifth R so these are facts next question hi I have a question [Music] uh and the normal person dies at 8085 so\n01:21:29 - my I'm curious to know when a yogi die with an accident uh what the the breaths are still there and I I'm just real to know that what happened to Yogi and a normal\n01:21:43 - man if if they di with accident but not a normal death so Madam you're not talking about a yogi he is a yogi practitioner his karma of death has come in the way and he has\n01:21:58 - right I'm talking about the perfected Yogi like Mah bab or like Krishna who got himself he permitted himself to be shot in the leg so those yogeshwar those perfected beings\n01:22:13 - have some yogis they called yog they go on the yogic path and then they say oh yeah this is not good let's let's take drink some it's very C and to become a perfected y it takes a\n01:22:37 - long time those who are not there and they die death all that means their karma is not finished they are not they cannot be called a yogi or yogeshwar so if he dies a normal death\n01:22:48 - he dies a normal death and that that amount of K okay which has been a humilated he either immediately comes to life and he he can do that in his next life that Crea for this person who is\n01:23:04 - not a perfected Yogi does not be wiped away he starts from where he left his brownie points you know what brownie points are right the the extra the good virtuous points are there and from that\n01:23:16 - he carries on he can carry on in on can give the example of Jesus Christ yeah but that now that that is also an important thing now the example of Jesus the example of\n01:23:32 - Jesus was that he took on the karma of that huge group of people uh who were there upon him and he redeemed those people you see in a small way like Shiva is the Redeemer of the whole universe\n01:23:48 - Christ was the Redeemer of a great part of humanity so he took upon himself the karma of others and he died now if the yogi takes upon himself the karma I take myself upon the karma of others and I go\n01:24:01 - that is my sacrifice for you that means I become the stronger with that if I die out of my own this thing that means I have not perfected yoga it's my own Karma some die due to the old K they are\n01:24:11 - not perfected some take on the karma of others and then they die the de they are called the Great sacrifice Mah Mah the great sacrifice\n01:24:25 - they take the karma of the whole of humanties past present and future they are such great people so this is this is how it works and you can never\n01:24:41 - die birth and death of the body is a mere chapter in the life story of your soul and you as the Living spirit flow on birth and death are just your body\n01:24:59 - which you've cast They the pearls of the string of the Sutra Atma that you are it goes through all the PS you have many personalities [Music]\n01:25:18 - [Applause] I'm not speaking from speaking this is the real reality that you are not a corruptible body but you are a Divine\n01:25:45 - Soul what I understand is that basically is the purification of the Soul purification and transformation it is an Alchemy of Total Transformation this\n01:26:02 - lifestyle has it an Alchemy of toal transformation where it transforms the physical body into the body of emotions passions passions into emotions emotions are purified into devotion devotion is\n01:26:19 - purified into a higher mind a steady mind and the is purified and becomes very very pure intuition and this intuition when it becomes as pure as the indwelling spirit\n01:26:36 - the Atma then there's no desire it doesn't stick the Atma doesn't stick there's no there's no it's it's not it's and so the\n01:26:49 - desire is not there the Mind shines as the soul and it is called pra the light of the soul and then the P separates itself from PR and stands in its pristine Glory it is called\n01:27:06 - the you are free from the travels of the earth and the senses your bliss is infinite it is very difficult to describe your State of Consciousness which reaches beyond the far limits of\n01:27:20 - the mind and matter of the universe you are yet Beyond it and it is impossible then for you to return again and suffer any Karma connected with this uh this planet the solar system the galaxies of\n01:27:35 - the universe then when you come down it is out of compassion at your own choosing to come down as an avar as a Divine descent this is how the purification it's a purification process\n01:27:50 - the more you purify yourself the more your Consciousness expands you purify your physical body Consciousness expanded or to pufy your emotional more expansion you purify your mental body\n01:28:01 - more expansion you purify tional body is more expansion and then as the tional body purifies then you the Supreme Spirit merges in the Universal spirit this is the Journey of Consciousness\n01:28:16 - through the various sheets and garments of your body is it huh ladies\n01:28:32 - [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] societ\n01:29:13 - [Music] [Music] [Music] in [Music]\n01:29:53 - [Music] [Music] and it [Music] because it good for our spiritual\n01:30:18 - [Music] growth we are for the ceremony hard vegian and [Music]\n01:30:39 - wean of child and suffering is definitely involved in this there's no doubt about it you have no choice but to bravely go through the but you take the sah and the Courage by\n01:31:30 - practicing insulate yourself from all disease practice k y and God be with you okay everything will be there [Music] [Music]\n01:31:56 - that stage that me practicing this will [Music] be yes yes of course of course it depends a lot on the radio about your past so when is it that you left those\n01:32:22 - mysterious activities okay I'm going to take this last question of [Music] youra to merchandise rest interact with\n01:32:50 - one another and then I will give you the experience of breathing through [Music] your go to the restroom you may want to interact then I will come get ready and\n01:33:13 - relaxed for the experience do not miss the experience because it is an actual happening in your lives once I come into your breath then your life start progressing and\n01:33:32 - [Music] [Music] moving very misch in your young age did you get this slowly or how it happen it say that in the night we used\n01:33:52 - to be the [Music] the greatest people who have drag R to the top like very another world\n01:34:28 - [Music] so I changed I was born like that and I carried on my natural process of and of the breath [Music]\n01:35:14 - [Music] Supreme reality so this is that you can change transform transform\n01:35:29 - namaskar you this evening you spoke about the technique for to whopped into this you so is there any other technique by which you can shorten your Lifan also I\n01:35:45 - just question the reason I'm asking this is because uh there is a possibility you might want to get your life to somebody uh you know who really wants to live uh so and I don't know I would just like to\n01:35:57 - have a bar check you know you can possibly sign it and give it to somebody else is there a technique to do that there are many techniques many techniques to show your\n01:36:08 - life [Music] okay I'm talking about doing it in way which is more about GI your life to somebody else because I'm good\n01:36:22 - idea the same person given the mic is it simp so there are sh in life and you see Shing of life is the purest processes that you can ask God [Applause]\n01:37:02 - second way you can shorten your life is that you have seen that you they overwork themselves the heart gets over the machine get TI blood pressure and then you Hospital arrest and then she's\n01:37:21 - gone she overworked herself so much that 66 68 she finished her life so that's the second way to shorten your life first is to pray for it which I second is to by and third to jump over the cff\n01:37:35 - and see that you surely these are three ways to short which I can think of I mean no disrespect to any person place or think not even to the cliff or the floor below but these are the three\n01:37:49 - things I can think of at the present moment it's a unique answer because if you shorten your life and you think that you live in peace with God no it's like a bul you break the bul but\n01:38:00 - the filament is still as long as your desire filament of desires is destroyed there no shortening your life there's no shortcut you will still have to come back immediately to\n01:38:13 - [Applause] [Music] your desires will have to be fulfill you have to come back to fulfill so there's no reason to shorten your life unless\n01:38:34 - you want a new body or something the body of man okay now last question I would like to make an announcement ladies and gentlemen\n01:38:46 - registrations for tomorrow's program at Z are happening outside also there's some tea anybody want to go to the washroom this is a short break of 10 minutes and we'll be getting back all\n01:38:58 - together for the experience that g will be giving us later I want to thank mrja very much for interrupting me so nicely and giving me a break I'm a top of tea and ladies I\n01:39:14 -

          "transcript": "00:02 - the only purpose of man's San on this Earth is to seek God calm your wondering thoughts and bring them back to the\n00:20 - center of your forehead at the midpoint between the eyebrows that is called the seat of the Soul unless the vagrant thoughts are quelled and\n00:35 - calmed it would be difficult for you to receive my message for my message is not a message in words words are the least of it my\n00:49 - message is an experiential message today I will give you a certain experience leading towards a\n01:09 - realization that humanity is one being humanity is a close-nit [Music] family it is Tied by the selfsame cord of Love\n01:28 - breath so if we are all all breathing the same breath of the Divine The Giver of the breath is the Divine The Giver of Life Force is the\n01:44 - Divine I am here tonight to let you know that we as World citizens\n02:03 - are united to make this place a better residence for us all a better place to live in it is to be a collected effort from\n02:21 - Humanity it is necessary for us all to realize that we are one human family some Minds may agree some Minds May disagree but the fact is that we were human beings first and then\n02:41 - Christians Muslims Hindus Buddhists these are all the religious colors and trappings put later on to form certain beliefs and\n02:58 - ideologies and certain rituals but no child when he is born says oh I'm a Seventh Day Adventist Hi how are you guys moment his umblical cord is cut and he\n03:13 - says it cries All Children Cry the same I think we have our basic habits and all over the mothers have the same affection for the children and the child does not say I'm a Seventh Day Adventist or I'm a\n03:26 -  or I belong to the Muslim Brotherhood no you belong to the human Brotherhood sir please correct yourselves you're not a\n03:38 - Christian nor a Muslim nor Hindu and that is the religion that is the non- denominational path of peace I have come here not to talk and teach you about religions or\n03:54 - Creeds I have come here to show you Pathways to peace and self-enlightenment which is not the Monopoly of any religion cult or\n04:08 - Creed far away from any religious cult or Creed they were human beings practicing in the salubrious climate of the Himalayas along the snow line where it\n04:22 - was not too cold and not too warm and their bodies were kept in a spiritually magnetized condition and their bodies were preserved these ancient\n04:37 - yogis they discovered the precise and rational science of the breath and found that due to patterns of breathing anxiety stress aggression negativity\n04:53 - could be dissolved into a positive state of Tranquility calm Integrity these qualities could be had by the precise and rational science of\n05:10 - breath called Kaa yog and it is Kaa yog that I am here to teach you shortly we shall be having a retreat at Fort Warden where we shall spend quality\n05:28 - time together living in peaceful coexistence as citizens of the world of course it's only for the baseball game or the basketball game that we have the New Yorkers and the\n05:48 - seites and the Orlando and all these you know the the socks and the fox and all these names which is they just identification for fun but BAS basically the underlying breath of all humanity is\n06:03 - the same you're breathing the same breath as the Chinese and the Mongolian and the Australian and the Indian and the Middle East and so is United States and Britain breathing the same\n06:17 - breath the Queen of England does not breathe a different breath than a normal Josh Mo in Seattle so let's get to our basics are basic and fundamental\n06:33 - right not according to the American Constitution of fundamental rights nor the Australian Russian or Indian constitution but according to Humanity's Constitution our fundamental right is to\n06:47 - breath breathe the Breath of God fearlessly and with love because this is your uniting prayer and if you don't do this prayer\n07:01 - sorry you shall die if you don't breathe because your basic prayer is the human breath I ask you this\n07:16 - question that for so many centuries there's been Christianity there has been Islam there's been Budd Buddhism\n07:31 - Hinduism and all these anties but nobody has thought of humanity why so what I stand for as I'll tell you\n07:45 - right now if Earth peace is to heral the dawn of the New Age We Must ALL realize that humanity is our uniting religion\n08:05 - breath are uniting prayer and Consciousness Our uniting God if we apply this as World citizens and every citizen in the world applies\n08:28 - this then I won't say that there will be peace on Earth then there will be hope for peace on Earth and Good Will to all human kind but with different religious\n08:42 - sects and political ideologies this is a far cry now the the religions in Disguise which create a lot of disharmony the modern religions are\n09:04 - what communism democracy dictatorship concealed dictatorship\n09:19 - Anarchy despotism all of them are trying to say that ours is the best religion and you see what a jumble we have in the Middle East and all over the\n09:32 - world you will say gurunath why you talking about this this is politics of course I will talk about it because I'm a citizen of the world and I have a right as much as the President of Russia\n09:43 - or America or India because it is you and I who's made them I if we didn't vote for them they wouldn't be there I I so we have a public forum here on which to discuss\n09:57 - the pathways to peace and we must set these differences aside we must set these differences aside if we are to live in peaceful coexistence in the\n10:10 - world I hope my talk to you is very simple and very clear I so let this be our motto of course I welcome a soul cry if you have a better Soul cry we will change it but so far I\n10:26 - went to the United Nations a few years back and I told them this that if Earth peace is to Herald the dawn of the new age let us all realize that humanity is our uniting\n10:39 - religion breath are uniting prayer and Consciousness are uniting God so the professor of the United Nations the person representing he said this should be written in letters of gold in the\n10:49 - United Nations so here we are trying to sincerely unite a people it's so easily to convince you all because you are the simple citizens of the United ations you have a certain Purity I don't say your\n11:03 - heart is totally Pure or it's totally white but I do say that there's a certain portion of space in your heart which is totally pure I that is the light of God that's his\n11:16 - spark shining in you so don't give up hope along the along the beam climb up to the Sun and become like the son your God and what does the Lord say\n11:31 - I am the sun you are my Ray I am the son you are my Ray you must become the whole by ceaseless meditation I your spirit shall unfold the ray become the blazing\n11:48 - sun the ray become the blazing sun yourself as me behold so this is what it is this is how the God Lord God encourages us this is the only thing we should be\n12:01 - thinking of and the only thing we should be doing and all the nations in the world today if they get together we can have peace people are making efforts for peace I'm not saying that we aren't\n12:15 - but Earth peace through self- peace shall not come about through a United Nations organization because there'll be political\n12:26 - agendas it'll come about through a United mind's organization I now to make your minds peaceful and\n12:40 - calm there's a certain Pathway to peace a certain life and livingness it's called a rhythmic breathing the science of Kaa yog which soothes your nerves and calms your\n12:54 - mind so you will be in a state of well-being and happy you will not have a sick mind you see a sick mind is always shooting one another always creating a disturbance but if\n13:07 - your mind is calm and has a state of well-being then why should you be an enemy to your neighbor why should you there's something wrong in the mind there's a certain aberration in the mind\n13:20 - there's a sickness and this sickness does not have to be dealt with by outside means of course there's the court there is the jewry there outer medicines but there's an inner pathway\n13:33 - too called the pathway of Union of the individual Consciousness with the universal Consciousness with you the individual Consciousness in unity with God the universal Consciousness and that\n13:46 - Unity of the individual with the universal Consciousness is called yog and to that purpose and teaching I am here before you to teach you that to make you experience that that this\n14:02 - pathway is non denominational it contradicts no religion but complement all and helps you do what you're doing better I take this\n14:14 - message oh Children of the Divine before it becomes too late we do not want to pay fines for what we have not done we don't want karmic\n14:30 - repercussions let us be custodians of the earth and of the Peace of humanity unless each one takes it upon himself to live his life according to peace the percepts of\n14:46 - Peace no change will come about but that is not enough he should be able to bring about that per and concept of Peace he should be able to bring that about this is very very important\n14:59 - important to know now I'm going to explain to you what Kaa yog is and after I explain to you what Kaa yog is I will take some question\n15:16 - answers Crea yog is the science of Life Force energy control it it is the science of rhythmic breathing with electricity in it the electricity is called\n15:31 - pran the K yog is a system of rhythmic spinal breathing which involves two currents the pric current and the aonic current it is to do with the\n15:48 - chiti which the Chinese took from us and made taii the original word of taii is found in the Sanskrit word of chiti India was a beacon of light and still is the\n16:00 - beacon of light for the whole world to live the inner life of peace and love and so the science and its techniques are all with the Indian Masters who are ready to give it freely to those who\n16:14 - practice deligently without any attachment of religion cult or Creed except that we are human beings we breathe and we have a Consciousness that's all\n16:29 - so when you exercise when you exercise the practice of Kaa yog you are breathing there's one breath which comes from the base of the spine from the perenium climbs up the\n16:47 - hollow tube of the spinal cord and rests in the center of the skull in the third eye this is known as the pric current it is is of a soothing nature and calms the\n17:02 - vagrant thoughts man and woman live in a bedum of misery created by their own thoughts I all of\n17:17 - us the practice of Kaa yog calms those thoughts and soon you are able to see a soft light of God since the body is also congealed light as you purify your body it becomes more and more of light and\n17:34 - less and less of matter yoga makes your body become more and more of light and less and less of matter that is the purpose are you trying to say gurunath that you're going to transform us into\n17:45 - the de the diva the light the flame yes daa Deo mahadeo the great God daa in Sanskrit means The Shining\n17:57 - ones in Italy they they call it de and we call it daa daa and de we also call it Deo so you are potentially de Gods The Shining ones covered in a in a\n18:13 - coat covered in a vest you know of the intuitional body a quat of the mental body over that over that you wear um an Overcoat of the physical\n18:27 - body so when you refine these quots you're able to see the Inner Light of your soul the Inner Light of your Consciousness through the practice of Kaa yog The upgoing breath calms soothes\n18:41 - the nerves and calms the mind and then from the third eye down to the perenium there's another current which you breathe it is called the aonic current the aonic\n18:52 - breath so the a panic current with when it goes down it is of a dissipating nature a disturb nature so when you go on it it's it is responsible for your perspiration for for defecation\n19:08 - urination anything which you throw out toxins of the body the pra burns the negativity and throws the toxins out and the aan evolves Consciousness and the pr the pr evolves Consciousness and the aan\n19:22 - burns your negative Karma that is the science of Kaa yog practice it and see for yourself how beautiful it is and you can those who believe in\n19:34 - Buddha can keep believing in I won't disturb the perfume of your faith those who believe in the Christ can keep believing in it in the Mary they can keep believing it those who believe in\n19:44 - Allah can keep believing in it those who believe in Lord Rah and Krishna can keep believing in it so we don't disturb your faith but you we give you the inner Pathway to truth and therefore it is a\n19:57 - must that not only must you try and be led into this technique empowered into this technique the door must be opened by initiation and practice it but also\n20:09 - spend quality time at the retreat we having at Fort Warden I think a week later Al so I do not know ex the exact date maybe week or 10 days later which would be worth your while the coming\n20:21 - because when I give you transmission constantly I'm playing upon the body cells and retarding the aging process I'm arrest tting the aging and Decay by yogic means when we sit in a what is\n20:34 - called a SAT s a true Gathering sat is true and is gathering where the aura and the magnetism of each rightful thinker like you are mixes with one another it's good company but it's\n20:50 - not more only good company in India the yogis know and we can see that each one of you now are of the same mindset you are spraying a fountain of love light which is mixing with the light of the\n21:01 - other fountains which others are spraying and so there's a jolly good spiritual atmosphere here yes this is true each one is a fountain of course the guru can blast a\n21:13 - bigger Fountain this way and that way and just merely by sitting in the aura of the master you can feel relieved and get healed aches and pains will go away if\n21:24 - you listen to my words like a child of five you'll see that your neck was it's gone away your back was stiff the back has become released you will see it as the satsung goes along healing will take\n21:37 - place by merely being in a spiritual Gathering if the master is true the effect must be true it has to be there there's nothing to hide if you are open and you don't have\n21:49 - a skeptic mind a negative mind some people I feel are very sensitive in these northern areas especially when I come and go towards Canada the few people who came they saw this without\n21:60 - giving a chance or hearing they looked and they walked out what they did I don't know they must have accidentally come in or something it's not not for them not for\n22:12 - them so when you practice this Crea you what it does is that it takes in an extra amount of O3 oxygen and it oxygenates your lungs you breathe with about 20 to 30% of your lungs the\n22:26 - practice of this selfing into the yourself the practice of this this this uh life force breathing it's not merely aerobic it's more it's life force breathing it makes your lungs breathe\n22:40 - with 50% 65% 75% 80% and when your lungs are filled with oxygen it gives that fresh O3 blood into the whole systemic\n22:53 - circulation by constantly inhaling and exhaling it's called pranayam the K yog the pranayam so what it does it keeps your body in a spiritually magnetized\n23:06 - Condition it's the first thing that Kaa yog does by burning the toxins of your body it keeps it in a spiritually magnetized condition now here a lot in Seattle and\n23:20 - other places especially ladies more the men also do it they follow the ladies of course but they're very interested in they when you ask them what are you doing I'm detoxing ladies always\n23:31 - detoxing see if you how about living life for no no I'm busy detoxing they eating these salads and gucha and all this stuff this fancy things so I've been in their company and I also they\n23:45 - detox me also they give me you have to have this gucha so you have to take it they're very strong and they in their conviction Caesar salad Garden salad gucha and all these nice things vitamin\n23:58 - k v vitamin C along with vitamin E get the free of the X radical it's a very nice thing and I'm very happy that they do it I've learned a lot from them the the\n24:12 - the the the salarians have are solid Arians they're very solid the salad Arians is very good so so it's good and so the the husband comes from work and all and he\n24:25 - have this things so he also has to eat it there's no question whether he likes it or not there's no way he he he doesn't stand a chance otherwise he's out if he doesn't need that he's in the\n24:38 - dog house everybody knows what the dog house is and everybody all of the men must have had a faint idea what the dog house is how it\n24:52 - feels okay now what I'm trying to tell you all is I've come with the good news that this breathing internally burns the toxins of your body it's it's a better detoxifier it burns the poisons it\n25:06 - detoxes you completely the Kaa yog if you do 144 day you'll feel your face is glowing and people will literally ask you what have you been doing what's wrong why is your face\n25:18 - glowing have you is there some secret you're hiding and you go to your girlfriend and she say she'll tell you you're definitely hiding a secret from me I won't talk to you unless you tell\n25:27 - me but if you if you practice regularly I promise you that your cells will be kept in a spiritually magnetized condition and you will detox your body this is very very important to\n25:43 - know so the first thing is detoxing the body throwing out the poisons you can keep to your salads and keep to your gucha and drinking a lot of water I'm not saying you shouldn't do that it's\n25:54 - very easy but do the pranayam second thing that the K yog does is that it gives you a peace of mind this comes later as you keep\n26:10 - practicing so first is keeps the body in a spiritually magnetized condition secondly it arrests the wear and tear of the body I'll tell you how if you're Brea taking Oxygen by Superior means of\n26:22 - Kaa yog and pranayam and your lungs are filled with you're breathing with 30 20% and then you're breathing with 80% you have more oxygen so the heart finds it unnecessary to\n26:34 - beat the heart they say in 24 hours it does 18 tons of work with the blood in the system and the energy expended equivalent to 18 tons when you breathe by Superior means of yog and\n26:49 - pranayam the heart beats slower because this oxygen is already filled in the lungs it does not need to work so hard so it sustains quiet so the heart instead of doing 18\n27:04 - tons of blood 18 tons of blood work in 24 hours will do only 6 tons and 3 tons and till a few pounds till the heart is rested then your body you are in a breathless\n27:19 - state of comfort no Suffocation and your body after many many many years is glowing with a radiant light if I should be in the Himalayas in a cave I would be transformed into\n27:34 - light since I come amongst the people and have to mix with people all over the world I cannot go into that intensity of Kaa I have to ground myself so I keep to my normal diet you\n27:50 - know but you will see the radiance in the light if you keep looking you'll still see a Radiance in the light sometime during the show you'll see the aura the light shining because not only\n28:00 - me all of you what are you made of you are made of congealed light don't be discouraged you're not made of coughing and sneezing because sometimes I'm fed up\n28:16 - I'm sneezing so much my God it's a pollen or some allergy or I'm coughing so much this is due to the aberration and a grosser permutation of this Con light\n28:28 - which your body is you have to transform this conal light so the heart is rested the heart the distilleries are purified the lungs are The Distillery of your body and the\n28:41 - heart is the pump so if you're giving your pump and your Distillery and your circulatory system rest what does that result in a\n28:52 - healthy and longer lifespan a healthy body a longer lifespan and quality life because then you won't be grumbling over your cough\n29:07 - and your back ache and headache you'll be in a state of well-being the wellness center you know now we have some tablets it's called The Wellness tablets right so from today on your\n29:21 - Wellness tablet will be the practice of Crea I see before you must try it before trying it don't jump to conclusions and before you try it let me\n29:33 - tell you in the beginning you'll feel your nausea or you'll feel a certain you know sickness or somebody May vomit all the toxins will be thrown out for the first two weeks let me warn you about\n29:44 - that don't be scared then you'll get into a certain negative State and as you keep practicing then you'll get a floating feeling perpetually calm then they'll ask you why you always\n29:57 - happy you you were such a grumpy thing before and now what's what's wrong so your friends will ask you so I'm saying try it out I'm telling you scientifically that your heart will be\n30:09 - arrested due to better Superior breathing breathing is the key and thirdly is it gives you a peace of mind uh mothers educate their\n30:22 - children but the Mind itself is distracted so whatever information they give through the the apple or the candle or the computer they may be very expensive I've seen very expensive Apple\n30:36 - computers and kle books and they have all the facilities but uhuh you're missing out on one main thing the Mind itself the Mind itself so dear Souls I\n30:51 - come from a backward third world country to an educated country and here's my message take it and see who's backward and how forward India was 7,000 years ago I made a little poem for educational\n31:07 - system for children as a leaking vessel as a leaking vessel never can fill the waters of life so pure and still so distracted mind fails to retain\n31:25 - wisdom's nectar in its brain I'm sure it hit the heart it touched you I have to touch your heart that's all and then the parents will get about seeing that their children are set right\n31:37 - you see computers may be good paper may be very glossy convenience may be there facilities may be there but if the Mind itself is distracted like a leaking vessel how much information will it get\n31:48 - does that seem to make sense I feeble I I okay to ease\n32:01 - disease it's it's a it's a mind a distracted mind is a mind ill at ease right I'm sorry I don't speak American because I've been educated in English so try to understand what I'm\n32:14 - saying a mind which is restless with itself is a mind ill at ease with itself right to ease disease of random mind a remedy suitable we must find a rhythmic breathing tension free\n32:36 - with concentration Sovereign key a rhythmic breathing tension free with Kaa yog The Sovereign key this is very very nice it's an educational thing to tell you that don't\n32:52 - try to you know put paper around every single apple and to spray uh anti-termite and anti uh you know Vermin uh fertilizers on every Apple work at the root man dig the roots\n33:09 - of the apple tree dig it let let the fresh soil come up Let the tree breathe give it some natural fertilizers you know give it some natural and then all the apples will grow good so by giving\n33:22 - merely computers and textbooks you can't improve the very person the human being the child he has to be improved by a more intrinsic and deeper method of rhythmic breathing called Kaa yog",

          "transcript": "00:20 - okay so now we will begin today's satsang and as I have told you that I am always there with you\n00:34 - as the president whether my physical being is there or not my presence is always with you and it depends upon you you how much you should obey\n00:51 - of my presence that will depend upon your receptivity your sincerity of practice and now we have come again we need this practice\n01:07 - and to give you a boost of evolution to give you an Alchemy of Total Transformation so the technique is the least of it the technique is just like a revision but\n01:21 - the actual transformation takes place by your mind coming in contact with my consciousness so when the consciousness of the circle\n01:40 - judges the mind of the disciple like I always tell you any mind when I say mind it's you see when I say Consciousness it's me can you all hear me at the back\n02:00 - if anybody disciple is a tune to an undifferentiated consciousness of the sadhu\n02:16 - that mind disciple becomes the sadhguru to the extent of its Attunement the presence with the undifferentiated consciousness of the circle if any mind is attuned to an\n02:33 - undifferentiated Consciousness then that mind becomes that Consciousness to the degree of [Music] your eye\n02:49 - do you understand it you do understand it would like to repeat it repeated if you don't say no it's a sacred thing\n03:02 - you don't have to repeat it I know that you know it I know that you do it in summon substance but you don't know the sequence what you know the same you know the spirit of what I said right but you\n03:13 - don't know the sequence so be rest assured that you are a constantly Progressive all of you my disciples are a gift of God\n03:34 - are a gift of God for me bye with many wrappings and troubles which I have to unwrap y\n03:47 - okay sometimes I have to tear the weapons apart sometimes I have to unwrap the wrappings but as I unwrap and peel the wrappings\n03:59 - layer after layer you you realize yourself and more divine this is what the whole game is about in playing the games of life\n04:19 - in a material world you are walking talking living gods covered by all the human weaknesses that they can be\n04:41 - I'm giving you why I'm talking to you like this I'm giving you a different of yourself so that you can be encouraged that you Who You Are but you are covered with the\n04:55 - fruit of the eye first you are covered fear the fear of death this is the first book that you are\n05:07 - covered with and why do you want to live he talks saying why do we do herbal medicines why do we do healthy exercises\n05:20 - and the reach you've been detox techniques they have all these things because of the fear of death we cling to life so it's a corollary it's it's connected\n05:32 - with one with the other but you is here to take away that fear of death because you are attached to your body Luke tells you that I am not the source\n05:47 - of Flesh and God Who Lies I am Immortal Consciousness lord of the earth and the skies this is what yoga tells you right I am spiritual truth I am not\n06:03 - divine I'm spiritual truth and love divine because body mind will be a dream how many people say this okay till you are sleeping or during the day\n06:14 - raise your hands they're all good disciples now you forgot don't forget now say it will remind you of your true self and make you overcome the fear of death\n06:29 - is that when my body dies what will be I'll be lost but your country makes you realize that you have something more than your physical body your emotional body your mental body\n06:43 - you are the Divinity Within These human trappings these are human trappings and as you refine yourself you learn to separate yourself from your\n06:54 - physical emotional and mental voice and when you realize yourself to be the spirit of your soul you are enlightened I this is the first barrier which you must\n07:06 - overcome the fear of death I will tell you about it to overcome the fear of death besides the practice of prayer yoga do try to understand\n07:28 - involves the fear of the unknown after I die I do not know what is going to happen I debit ignorance\n07:43 - an identity crisis that I will lose my identity my sister my brother my father my mother my children all these beautiful friends I have\n07:57 - a beautiful life I'm living all my work which I do and I'm social worker I work for them I give them medicines I give them love I give them flowers all\n08:10 - my identities with my friends will be gone so if I lose my identity I lose my friends my father my sister and all my relatives right that is the second fear\n08:26 - now I'm telling you these things which will give you great solace I'm not here to teach you yoga classes or techniques and all I'm here to do the actual thing\n08:38 - I'm here to transform you not to teach you have you understood how many of you have you here thought I have come to teach you raise your hands how many of you here\n08:55 - feel that I've come to transform you and evolve your raise your hands everybody there you are also wrong how many of you you thought you'd pick me\n09:08 - how many of you have seen that I have come to teach you and to transform you raise your hands no you cannot read your answers so now whom this praise the man so you\n09:24 - see teaching is compulsory for me because your mind is in a habit of teaching and being God is the habit of mind if I don't say anything I'll be doing\n09:34 - that just as much but you won't be satisfied because you're used to words teaching is just the pointer to the transformation now let me give you some comfort do not\n09:51 - be afraid of death the first thing is every night when you go to a dream you less sleep use your identity I they do not know\n10:10 - whether you are a man or a woman in previously bye okay when you sleep there is no fear of the unknown because you are healthy and doom you have no identity and you are in an\n10:27 - unknown state that is death does that give you solace every night you die I Die daily when you sleep and sleep to sleep suppose you have a dream in your\n10:44 - sleep in the dream you at least know that you are not the physical body I am a dream body an astral body\n10:55 - that also gives you the information that you have something more than your physical body to which you people are attaching yourself\n11:07 - I want your feedback on this have you got some relief have you got a clearer understanding not to fear death can somebody give me is speak like a child this is your family at home say what you\n11:19 - felt after I told you did you feel relieved or did you feel that yes there is a solution and practicing death every day that is not as bad as it is what you feel give me your feedback\n11:31 - yes I don't need to have in fear there's nothing to be here for us see because after I told you this is\n11:45 - yes yes I feel like my mind agrees with you and my mind says yes this all makes sense but I was failing to uh to shift my identity to the soul for that\n11:58 - experience because intellectually so you can't argue we've all experienced sleep we've all to experience dreams and I don't I don't I don't get what you're trying to say yo what what did you feel\n12:09 - did you feel good or did you feel augmentative or did you want to put your logic against my launch in my experience what did you see put your theoretical argument against a\n12:20 - man whose experienced right death look yeah that's supposed to mind I like them so for many years we have this sort of mind has been transformed very little it was even five years ago you had good\n12:33 - some argument I like this like this so what are you trying to say tell me in simple language what did you feel after I explained this did you feel that some explanation had\n12:44 - been given to you I I feel like it even shows that your mind do you feel in the mind the mind is difficult excuse me speak softly you feel that mind is defeated by the mind\n12:57 - yes but if your mind is defeated by the mind I mean because if there's no other place to go out there my mind defeated your mind by giving you the answers to the\n13:08 - questions you didn't know is that what you mean yes so every night you are practicing that so fear not Let It Come the third fear and articulation\n13:25 - some people die of cancer some people die of suffering some people die of an accident this is the fear I\n13:38 - took the third fear for this fear the remedies to practice kriya yoga and if you won't break a leg before you die\n13:50 - you may just sprain it you will lessen the impact of your Bad Karma With all it is to come that is the answer if you understood practice sincerely\n14:02 - the region of gentle abrasion of the kriya breath mitigates the suffering of your past in this life the breath acts upon like you have it feels it feeds the\n14:17 - effect of your Bad Karma like if you have a stab and a step do you like this answer Does this answer satisfy you what free are you does the repetitive practice it fades away\n14:56 - the negative effect of Priya yoga the gentle abrasion of the breath wipes away the evil some scars of the past now I take your feedback I've given answers to this they have answered the\n15:11 - fear of death and I'm giving you the answers to this but remember one thing how many people were aware I know you like the answer you were aware you could feel it some of\n15:22 - you were aware but feel that some of you would not have had still could feed the transformation when I'm speaking to you I'm not only talking as I said I'm also transforming you\n15:31 - how many facts that I've transforming you while I talk with your hands good yes yes tell me what is your name Rina you've been here for many many\n15:48 - years you're coming from progressing well yes for me when at night when I sleep I go away but\n16:03 - I don't know like I don't see myself as a soul like I don't know the experience anything you know it's just nothing that is good because your soul is also a very thin film of light\n16:19 - which is known as the Divine mind that means you transcend the Divine mind also in your deep sleep where you don't feel your soul you touch your Consciousness that is the Divine\n16:33 - Consciousness and since you are too small you cannot comprehend that Consciousness I also as a little child when I went to that state I could not feed my soul because it had expanded\n16:46 - into something so vast that I was just nothing right we feel we are nothing that's so useful that's right that's how you should feel that's good everybody feels that in a dreamless sleep it is\n17:00 - called sushi but in swapna which is a dreamful sleep you will stream yourself you'll be even then you can have your family a woman form when you're talking to your friends\n17:11 - or you're flying you're eating nicer parts of mangoes or sudden you start flying that is all in the dream state so that's very good when you go in a dreamless sleep you are\n17:22 - not supposed to feed anything just still this but you feel no fear also but that's the cartoon uh when I become aware like my body\n17:34 - has fear you are not aware because your body your mind is not ready to receive the consciousness what you might as well\n17:49 - it is really your Consciousness to the degree of its achievement with that consciousness I said the Consciousness the thing that you don't feel the nothing is the circle\n17:59 - and you are the disciple but since a small Speck has been thrown in the ocean it won't know it gets lost right you understand you will feel the awareness keep practicing clearly next\n18:09 - question next person feedback even when I meditate like I'm no longer on stage\n18:25 - I'm just like this yeah and what do you feel asleep you're the Watcher stand in front of your interview have asked it awareness\n19:03 - to my view is that at that level you might visit Divine mind interferes in the Divine conscience okay now I come to the next\n19:27 - you must the next is how to get rid by your practice of the second difficulty with besides us the second quote my disciples are the gift of God not feeling of the second layer\n19:46 - second player I am sending my poems it is joy and sorrow we are always on the emotional pendulum of Love and Hate\n20:08 - and so on depression and how good mind works abilities made of a steady mind\n20:24 - practice your importance attractive because one moment we are happy time something sad happens to be a try to have incredibility\n20:41 - right now equality and I move it The Duality of opposites the emotional pendulum response duality of opposites it's sweet to override\n20:56 - take me with me on to the other side they say America [Music] you go to the other side where there is\n21:10 - no giant sorrow I am ever in Bliss and moved so what is the state of the UK what will be your state when you overcome the second traffic\n21:26 - affected by any happy things you don't answer Joy he sorrow after you start crying either be affected by a job normal\n21:40 - I think now tell me which all this is wrong but I had a poem for you all in any case second graphic which the yoga must Endeavor to be is this this is when you\n21:55 - become that state this is what you are closer to God in joy and sovereign [Music] [Applause]\n22:33 - duality of opposites teach me to override take me with you Spirit free on to the other side now you know what it means that is attraction and rather duration that has to be overcome\n22:47 - that is the second graphic which the guru helps you to unwrap this is a bearing of hopes which you have the process live is the fear of death that is\n22:59 - intensible of death therefore clinging to life that itself is a duality of the opposites so how do we override it by the equal breath of Priya yoga by mahamudra by the\n23:16 - by by the the uh these are the things which who and duality of opposite steady mind it's very important\n23:37 - you'll get a steady mind in that I have given this very clearly that you must get off the emotional eye but still it's difficult right those lives\n24:02 - right practicing things are taken off by a master by his male president s and tell you the magical\n24:26 - everybody cannot be they are always thinking neutralizes your negative Karma I can't hurry with you because this is not doing anything of the brain cells\n24:47 - neutralizes your karma organizes your karma so I do not take you in part of a side no mind all the time I and sometimes if you know you are able to do it\n25:04 - you will protect the presence the presence is the presence anyone who gets to that state is in the presence meditation\n25:24 - because it helps me to make you pay more attention to transformative so that the third one is a very tricky thing it is called\n25:41 - the ego I am this the ecos the aggregating principle in the human body and if you don't have an ego you can't\n25:55 - live your day-to-day life happily going to office contacting people going to society going to Sunday Saturday evening [Music] and better than the time of my heart is\n26:19 - better the next time for next Sunday you won't buy the better night not only women do it mentally also they train Upstream to one another this is a natural human thing\n26:33 - but it comes in the way of your spiritual progress the ego is the eye the feeling of I amness I am Superior to this person I am better than this person I am the first amongst people that the\n26:52 - danger oh the rest of the devil is sitting up okay I'm sitting on the control let me focused\n27:04 - becomes so prominent that sticks out like a short pump do you think you're being humble and the wondering you are giving a great email to your ego your humility\n27:20 - becomes very evil so watch for that how this ego has to dissipate I have made two poems of the ego what is really individually though and what is for the possibility\n27:42 - the individual people watches the individual people let us see find out first the individual is me and mine about my personal affairs\n27:54 - and my personal things about the past months of welfare about us the whether you fake it to experience the welfare of the whole world climate\n28:06 - against fear of other planets the individual people the more myself the more myself the more of my eye death\n28:24 - disappear the more they are and you say my heart as in the morning for myself so instead my true self and my apparent\n28:55 - said what is my apparentship oh the audience of this event's map out my body my mind my clothes my Society status\n29:09 - my you know settlement everyone says by the way did you suicide is very suddenly used if they're going into society princess\n29:26 - princess queen queen sister Princess and the sister younger sister but still princess games games\n29:44 - but someday we have to get away when I was a child I believed in childish toys they can get more control\n30:00 - even men play these Evil games and somebody calls you don't take photos if I do presence to give up an extra good present to honor you give the lesson to the other so basically\n30:22 - you have to be very careful this is called egotistic attitude no matter they have another word for eating individually who is for attitude is that right\n30:41 - it's evil so you get rid of that by the constant practice in annihilations waste life today to taste us\n31:10 - [Music] forgiven forget times before [Music] I say I know how to say we did\n31:33 - put us in the morning today it is probably good life [Music] so I can do not fight with my sister [Music]\n31:54 - will be same time fighting with my sister or brother and there's no I don't know when would you come to me come to me now me adoption can be original\n32:14 - give me adoption give me your mission somebody sent me a post office he said time is too short and he gave an example [Music]\n32:32 - one lady it is [Music] why don't you say anything listen what is the point getting into an\n32:56 - argument that is too short I'm getting off in the next stop I don't know waste my time fighting with you this is what life is all about\n33:10 - if somebody said something to you so give them forget it stuff but if you say oh you are right now\n33:31 - prepared to thank you so so yes with our friends and Friends has been that is crucial\n33:47 - I'm not preaching I'm not telling you a fact forget it focus on the main thing that matters so what does\n34:01 - say on the island to disappear disappear the more my myself as I said it's still got a larger before possibility was this\n34:23 - the more and more I Disappeared upon the self as God gave us not myself or thyself that is so the individual Universe something hurts you something makes you\n34:41 - happy but your Atma remember so that which is happy or which is sad it's usually\n34:54 - but the spirit has enough but when you go to the hospital [Music] that means more and more ideas\n35:05 - [Music] the skies Cosmic dreams always will be to realize that for that realization\n35:29 - is a thin film [Applause] is not a I am very devotee State it's not dentured with our advantage to just the feeling that I am the\n35:45 - divinity so how can we describe the last week I [Music] understand the individual night I have not spend the costly\n36:11 - a limitation of the Mind electrons programs just in essence\n36:38 - of the feeling that you are there's an essence of the feeling that you are but it is if this Essence is flipped over it is the essence of the feeling\n36:52 - that there is [Music] back again there's the essence of the feeling that I have the customers because it is your true feeling\n37:06 - United in the Divine mind and nature we're going to flip it across it is a it is again a master feeling of emerging into the Divine Consciousness not the Divine eye\n37:18 - of the philosophy the cosmic awareness so there's a cosmic awareness which is the essence of of this of this feeding of Allah not iPad\n37:34 - Louis which is awesome against the cosmic eye when you feel it is that that awareness which is light emerges\n37:58 - Consciousness to understand more and more you know myself [Music]\n38:18 - the more and more the more and more I disappeared the more the self has gone to this that's the possible time have you seen the difference\n38:34 - [Music] oh myself [Music] [Music] we must get rid of it by a constant\n38:49 - practice of kriya yoga and look at something that you need amassed to like when I go off and I used to practice the soil I practice it to teach\n39:01 - others all of your group is outside a big world today I came by this side that's it they're all in my way to see many people you are the great people you come from families\n39:13 - have spoiled your little girls and boys to the side [Music] who used to say leave your leave your mind\n39:24 - [Music] even with my friends put your shoes [Music] it's an excellent way\n39:40 - to Humble your people yes I am the shoe Bearer but some of you will find it very difficult to do it even now the other thing is\n39:57 - the worker doesn't come the day he doesn't come and clean the violence you're just cleaning food management of others it's just food management for six months and\n40:20 - to go I had [Music] with literally I and for a college it's a bigger fiber\n40:38 - yeah they are very high ER than cheese slated comes up as we smell the goals in the internet\n41:10 - having the techniques of dissolving the movie humble job in the afternoon if you understand so that is the second\n41:22 - thing [Music] help another blind person across the road there are many things to do you don't have to be the only one always\n41:34 - always [Music] thank you so everybody knew us that's a good thing so you have to lessen this ego Because\n42:00 -

receptivity your sincerity of practice and now we have come again we need this practice and to give you a boost of evolution to give you an Alchemy of Total\n01:03 - Transformation so the technique is the least of it the technique is just like a division but the actual transformation takes place by your\n01:18 - mind coming in contact with my consciousness touches the mind of the disciple I can always tell you if any mind when I say mind it's you\n01:44 - when I say Consciousness it's me and you always hear me at the back I I if any mind disciple is a dude\n02:01 - to an undifferentiated consciousness of something that mind disciple becomes the sadhu to the extent of its achievement with the presence with the\n02:19 - undifferentiated consciousness of the circle if any mind is attuned to an undifferentiated Consciousness then that mind becomes that Consciousness to the\n02:28 - degree of its achievement with that consciousness I thank you if you don't say no it's a sacred thing\n02:53 - you don't have to repeat it I know that you're going I know that you do it it's solid substance but you don't know the sequence what you know to say you know the spirit of God said right but you\n03:04 - don't know the sequence so be rest assured that you are constantly Progressive all of you my disciples are gift of God\n03:22 - for me are a gift of God for me wow that many wrappings and travels which I have to understand\n03:38 - okay sometimes I have to gather weapons apart from unwrap the rabbits but as I uncraft and peel the Rapids layer after air you you realize yourself\n03:56 - and more divine this is what the whole game is about they playing the games of life in a material world you are walking talking\n04:22 - with gods covered by all the human weaknesses that they can do I'm giving you I am talking to you like this and give me a different\n04:36 - view of yourself so that you can be employed that you you are the Living God but you are covered with the quote of the eye first you are covered with the goal of\n04:51 - fear the fear of death this is the first book that you are coming with and why\n05:01 - do you want to live why do we do detoxing why do we do herbal medicines why do we do healthy exercises and the rejuven detox techniques they have all these things\n05:16 - because of the fear of death we cling to life so it's a problem it's connected with one with the other but you is here\n05:30 - to take away that fear of death because you are attached to your body yoga tells you that I am mother's house of Flesh and go home and dies I am Immortal Consciousness\n05:44 - lord of the earth and his gods thank you this is right I I am spiritual truth I love divine I'm Spirit of Truth and I'm Divine this\n05:59 - body mind will dream of mine how many people say this okay till you are sleeping or you're in today raise your hands they're all good disciples now you\n06:08 - forgot don't forget now see if you remind you of your true self and make you overcome the fear of death you feel that when my body dies what will be I'll be lost foreign\n06:40 - yourself you learn to separate yourself from your physical emotion and mental voice when you realize yourself to be the spirit of your soul\n06:50 - you are enlightened I overcome the fear of death I will tell you how to overcome the fear of death\n07:07 - besides the practice of career yoga who try to understand that the fear of death involves the fear of the unknown\n07:27 - after I die I do not know what is going to happen I then it involves an identity crisis that I will lose my identity\n07:40 - my sister my brother my father my mother my children all these beautiful friends I have the beautiful life I'm living all my work which I do I'm such a great\n07:53 - social worker I work for them I give them many students I give them now I give them flowers all of my identity with my friends will be gone\n08:05 - if I lose my identity I lose my friends my father my sister all my relatives right that is the second fear now I'm telling you these things which will give you great solace\n08:22 - I'm not here to teach you yoga classes or techniques and all I'm here to do the actual thing and it'll transform you not to teach you how many of you have you here thought I\n08:37 - have come to teach you raise your hands how many of you here think that I've come to transform you and evolve your vision everybody right you're also wrong\n08:56 - how many of you you thought you were treated how many of you here feel that I have come to teach you and transform you\n09:08 - Praise Your Hands no you cannot raise your hands now who didn't raise the hand you see teaching his number three for me because your mind is in a habit of teaching and\n09:19 - being pure it's the habit of mind if I don't see anything I'll be being asked yourself but you won't be satisfied because you lose your words okay\n09:36 - teaching is just a pointer to the transformation and let me give you some comfort do not be afraid of death the first thing is\n09:48 - every night when you go to a dream you just sleep use your identity I you do not know whether you are a man or a woman in previous sleep I\n10:05 - it will add when you sleep there is no fear of the unknown because you are healthy alone you have no identity and you are in an unknown state that is death\n10:23 - does that give you solace every night you die I Die daily when you sleep and sleep to sleep suppose you have a dream in your sleep\n10:38 - in the dream you at least know that you are not the physical body I am a dream boy an astral body that also gives you the information\n10:49 - that you have something more than your physical body to which you people are attaching yourself you got some relief have you got a general understanding not with your\n11:03 - death that somebody can be speak like a child this is your family at home say what you felt after I told you did you feel relieved or did you feel that yes there is a solution and practicing that\n11:16 - every day that is not as bad as it is what you feel give your feedback whatever little feedback yes I'm here you feel this after I told you this\n11:34 - is yes I feel like my mind is used to be or my mind says yes this all makes sense but I was failing to uh shift my identity with the soul but I experienced\n11:49 - because intellectually sound you can't argue we've all experienced C but all of the serious reads I don't I don't I don't get what you're trying to say yo what what did\n11:60 - you feel did you feel good or did you feel augmentative or did you want to put your logic against my launching my experience what did you feel they want to put your theoretical argument against\n12:10 - a man whose experience right yeah what did you feel after I explained this did you feel that some explanation had been given to you I feel like it shows that your mind should be free of the\n12:41 - body the mind will defeat excuse me speak softly you feel that mind is defeated by the mind or even mind is defeated by the mind I mean because there's no other place to\n12:55 - go with it my mind defeated your mind by giving you the answers to the questions you need to know is that what you mean yes so every night you are practicing death\n13:08 - so fear not Let It Come the third fear and articulation if some people die of cancer some people die suffering some people die of an\n13:23 - accident this is the fear hi this is the third field for this fear the remedy is practice kriya yoga\n13:37 - and who break a leg before you die you'll be just Freedom you will lessen the impact of your Bad Karma irritologist to God that is the answer if you understood so\n13:50 - practice sincerely creation of gentle abrasion of the kriya breath mitigates the suffering of your past and his life\n14:02 - the breath acts upon like you have it feels it feeds the effect of your back permanently if you have a staph and a step if people prepare for being and is chapter to the\n14:16 - first prayer practice to stop it the ink is clear secondly you slap it it's more fitting in your mind sometimes practice it's even more faithful for them is practically disappears\n14:31 - right machine all right yes so do you like this answer is this answer satisfy you for Korea you does gentlemen at the back and go out and feed about this answer the repetitive\n14:44 - practice it fades away the negative effect of real the gentle operation of the breath wipes away the evil some scars of the past I take your feedback I'll give you\n15:00 - answers to this we have answered the fear of death and I've given you the answers to this but remember one thing how many people were aware I know you like the answer some of you were very\n15:12 - confident some of you are aware but you know some of you were not aware when I'm speaking to you or not only talking to you as I said I'm also transforming you\n15:22 - but yes tell me what is your name Rina you've been here for many many years you're coming from progressing well\n15:46 - you must believe us when I see like uh yeah I guess some people are away but I don't feel myself as a soul like thank you if you wanted more life\n16:03 - so it doesn't come right now has it it has become lighter I can't see you your light is not shining enough that's\n16:25 - what I'm trying to do to get it yes or no please come and my disciples of God they have unique the ladies with the softest voice\n16:38 - they sit right at the back the softest voice and the most accented again is it in the back and the people who have a moving voice says it in front\n16:50 - what do God and safety if you can come closer then I would appreciate this very much yes for me when at night when I sleep\n17:08 - I go away but I don't know like I don't see myself as a soul like I don't want to experience anything you know it's just nothing that is good because your soul is on for\n17:24 - a very thin film of light orders the Divya prakudi the Divine mind that means you to upsend the Divine mind also in your deep sleep where you don't feel your soul you touch your\n17:38 - Consciousness that is the Divine Consciousness and since you are too small you cannot comprehend that consciousness I also as a little child when I went to that street I could not\n17:50 - feel my soul because it had expanded into something so vast that I was just nothing right we feel we are nothing that's so useful that's how you should feel that's good everybody feels that in\n18:06 - a dreamless sleep it is called sushi but in swarna which is a dreamful sleep we will experience every day even then you can have your family a woman form and you're talking to your friends or\n18:18 - you're eating nice and parts of ankles or something you start flying that is all in the dream state so that's very good that you go in a previously you are not\n18:30 - supposed to feed anything just steal this but you feel no fear also the lesson when I become aware like my body yes\n18:43 - here you are not aware because your body your mind is not ready to receive the Consciousness it is sleep which is trying to evolutely the moment your mind\n18:54 - is ready it will be transformed to your Consciousness to the degree of its accurate preciousness said the Consciousness the thing that\n19:03 - you don't feel the nothing is the circle and you are the disciple but since a small sweat has been thrown in the ocean It won't always gets lost right  you will feel the awareness keep\n19:15 - practicing clearly next question next person feedback yes um yes\n19:47 - when I dream or even when I meditate I feel like I'm no longer on stage because I just anyhow of surgery so that's very good and what do you feel\n20:07 - asleep saying I'm just watching I'm just I'm just chilling in your sleep and what do you feel now video standing in front of your circle\n20:26 - humility you feed the master awareness you all the time yeah so I agree with that at that level there is no thought there must be no\n20:40 - problem but there's not that it's not me it's not the blessings then your mind is interfering in the presence the Divine mind interferes in the Divine consciousness\n20:50 - episode so that's very good okay now I come to the next how to get rid on your practice now the second difficulty with precepts us the second\n21:08 - quote the layer of the gift of God my disciples are the gift of God I am feeding off the second layer in the second layer\n21:27 - I'm sending my poems away it is the pair of opposites joy and sorrow we are always on the emotional pendulum of love and he\n21:40 - join and sorrow depression and happiness this is how the emotional pendulum of the human mind works this is a great turbulence in in the way of a steady mind\n21:56 - it distracts you in concentration is distracted because one moment we are happy with happy things then after some time something sad I will be upset we must\n22:10 - try to have equality we must try to have equality in our emotions this duality of opposites teach me to override\n22:29 - take me with thee your spirit free onto the other side on the other side they say you are better than after your body dies you're going to the spirit rare but you have\n22:40 - said samani you go to the other side where there is no joy and sorrow I'm ever in Bliss and move unmoved\n22:52 - so what is the state of a yogi what will be your state when you overcome the second rapid be affected by any happy things you John Answer Joy if anything sorrow happens\n23:03 - you start crying either be affected by Joy I think maybe dad go with me our Korean dad who will be able to tell us is here\n23:27 - where is he ago I'm going to I see it boy I'm going to embed the poems from it you don't have to come here [Music]\n23:55 - father the water should be put next time foreign joy and so I do not ever that Eternal Spark\n24:42 - in honor is on to your viewing everything don't you appreciate it thank you very\n24:57 - much I don't like you to input into your own don't do that at home affect my teaching but I need some feedback otherwise I'd rather speak to the woman whoever\n25:09 - speaking to you dog they can respond in some way so I know that this is well appreciated but it's sunk into your head for everything enjoy your sort of like a\n25:23 - dog he ever that Eternal Spa in honor and dishonor to constant Duty take me the day of spirit free onto the other side\n25:33 - so that is it's all about that this value deposits teach me to override take me with deals give it free up to the other side now you know what it means that is attraction\n25:46 - issue that has to be overcome that is the second bracket we should do helps you to contract is about your course you know when you go to mountaineering and you go\n25:57 - oh my God it's good the people that I beat like if George is going with some other some engineering person is going he said or not\n26:09 - don't wear pullovers they have slipped through it's not layering now I would have bearing slight verbal inside if I had a simple jacket or my jacket\n26:29 - didn't take it off that's what he said and you go I attitude so this is a layering of hopes which you have the process there is the deal of\n26:46 - death that is intensible that itself is a duality of hypothesis so how do we override it by the equal brand of Priya yoga by mahamudra by the the naming kriya without\n27:13 - these are the things which remove the duality of opposite steady mind so that's very important so do the prayer do the normal prayer and get a steady mind\n27:53 - hi I mean what brand it was the first thing my first name is Randy RSVP which one my first name is Freddie Smith\n28:14 - Randy Smith are you still in your same location which will bring the nursing Physical Therapy Well Physical Therapy Therapies as it brings the layers of the onion so\n28:30 - the layers of your mind are clean the processed layer of fear and life the yogi removes the mass then he removes The Duality of opposites Joy of Sorrow light and dark life and\n28:44 - death you don't need to be swayed by this you are yogis be constant all right so that is the second you must get off the emotional pendulum how many of you have read my little book\n29:02 - your potential raise your hands yes in that I have given this very clearly that you must get off the emotional mental eye still it's difficult right\n29:18 - lives when life's difficulties hit you and you know it's not so it's easier said and uh right so that is the second thing and as you keep practicing these rabbits\n29:38 - are taken off by your master by his mere presence this bear presence I'll tell you the magic of the Indian presence because everybody cannot be their brothers they\n29:51 - are always thinking their presence neutralizes your negative Karma I can't hurry with you because this is a language which is never spoken\n30:04 - foreign cells equalizes your karma that's why it will not take certain part of a style no mind all the time I am sometimes when you\n30:24 - walk you are able to do anything when you contact a presence the presence is the presence anyone who gets to that state is in the presence\n30:44 - any questions about he will pendulum by the emotional better than day-to-day life raise your hands she was our last day bye\n31:08 - invented to raise your hands give them a hands you practice again and again I don't\n31:26 - like you to meditate because I am your meditation please open your eyes don't do your own stuff don't do your own thingy okay then I'm here alone okie\n31:39 - dokie because I'm here okay and I'm your dog okay all right thank you and then we'll be a big baby and you\n31:53 - will not progress you will get because my actions everything is involving you so when suppose before you ease your meditation it helps me to\n32:06 - take to pay more attention because the third part is a very tricky thing it is horrible in the human body and if you don't have an ego\n32:33 - you can't live your day-to-day life normally going to Office contact and give you going to society going to Sunday Sunday evening hours wearing a mistress and your beautiful\n32:49 - hands visited my hats and places all over the place and then there is a competition that deserve that better than mine my husband the next time for next Sunday owned by the better night\n33:02 - not only women who inventory also they drive Upstream to one another this is a natural human thing when it comes in the way of your spiritual progress the evil is the eye\n33:17 - the feeling of I amness I am Superior person I am better than this person I am basically and today I've seen before\n33:39 - that he focus on number one so your humility becomes so prominent that it sticks up and your soul come today you are giving a great leaving to your ego your\n33:58 - humidity becomes available so much for that now this evil has to be so big made two goals of the ego one is for the individual ego\n34:17 - and what is for the possibility the individual people watches individually would let us see find out first the individually moved\n34:29 -

          "title": "Life After Death - Taking the Kingdom of Heaven By Storm",
          "transcript": "00:11 - today the topic will be life after death the life after death which in india we call devachan or devasthan\n00:27 - what does happens to the soul after death till its next reincarnation this was originally discovered and intuited\n00:44 - by the ancient sages of india thousands of years ago and you can find the details of the life after death in the brahminical rituals of the\n00:58 - shraddha it is called shraddha another place you can find the original of this is in a book called the garud quran\n01:18 - what are the turns and twists and an evolutionary journey in the life after death till the soul is reborn again thousands of years later the tibetans\n01:29 - got to know this knowledge from india and they came up with a book the book of the dead which also deals with the bardo\n01:39 - third means the journey of the soul after death till next reincarnation now i will speak two portions of this first i will tell you the normal journey\n01:51 - the original knowledge is not in the bardo third hall of the tibetan book of the dead but it is in the shrads of the ancient brahman the book of the garud quran has\n02:00 - it and later there are other detailed books which i will mention to you and referred later on in some future lecture they are of an advanced nature\n02:15 - now the soul is an immortal entity which resides in the body of every human being the soul it is called the jiva means life\n02:35 - it is called the furohar mean the soul in various languages the jivatma the furohar the rooh you see now means\n02:51 - light also go here so the guru is the one who has the gravity to reveal the hidden light and knowledge of the soul the guru here\n03:08 - the secret knowledge of the soul and bringing it to light is the work of the guru he who from the darkness takes the soul to light\n03:19 - is the guru go here so it takes you to know your rooh and this is the original meaning of rohani ilm the guru guru gives you the rouhani elm\n03:33 - for he takes you away from the ignorance of matter into the light of the soul into the light of the ruha into the light of god\n03:44 - of khuda of ishwar this is the work of the guru and guru means gravity his words have so much gravity that they can even transform matter into\n03:56 - light into spirit therefore it is very very important not only to hear the words of the guru but to follow his practices as well and transform yourself\n04:10 - into light and love and divinity now the soul residing in the body has a lifespan this lifespan differs from individual to\n04:29 - individual as per his individual karma you see he lives his life he does good deeds neutral deeds bad deeds\n04:43 - all this is collected in his akashic records or in his collective subconscious it goes towards the building up of his sanchita karma\n04:57 - but in his present life he is working out his present karma in this life so the normal soul lives his life then he comes to old age\n05:14 - and after some time the body gets old like your garments get old and torn and they have to be discarded so in the srimad bhagavad-gita it says\n05:27 - just as garments get old and have to be discarded so also the body is discarded and the soul goes to the life after death to reincarnate in\n05:38 - another body the body is mortal and dies but the soul is immortal and in the bhagavad-gita as it is it is mentioned the soul is immortal\n05:51 - for weapons cannot pierce it the water cannot wet it the breeze cannot dry it and fire cannot burn it the geetha just said therefore the soul is immortal so what\n06:10 - happens to the soul even though the soul is immortal at the time of death it is covered with the with the karma of the emotions and the mind it is covered\n06:23 - with certain good karmas certain intuitional activities and karma then certain mental activities it is coated with\n06:31 - then the outer coat is emotional activities and then there are certain gross passional activities which cover the indwelling soul so the soul\n06:39 - leaves the outermost coat which is the physical casement or the physical garment but it's subtle emotional and mental garments it keeps\n06:51 - as it is cremated in the indian system the body is burnt the physical body the garment which is not the soul the apparent self is burnt and the true self the soul\n07:03 - along with its emotions and its mental body passes out of the body now it goes into the afterlife after death\n07:15 - state of life in india there is no after death because for the soul there is no death so they can how can they be after death but the tibetans have said and the\n07:25 - normal people call it death but only the physical body dies after that it works out its karma in the life after the death of the physical body then\n07:36 - the emotional body dies then the mental body is clear and dissolves and then the soul remains in its pristine purity to enjoy itself with god\n07:45 - and then again it reincarnates taking these bodies again another emotional body as per its sanchita karma another mental body as per such\n07:56 - intuitional body then a mental body then an etheric body and then a physical body it incarnates in the womb of a mother to uh to whom it is more suitable for his\n08:08 - karma that parents who give that soul the maximum facilities for spiritual evolution so the life after death is such for the soul that it\n08:18 - goes coated with the intuitional mental and emotional bodies discarding its physical body then it starts\n08:31 - its work from the outside in it is worked on it goes to a state called the prath lok after the body is burnt or it's buried\n08:44 - for 72 hours it is in the prath lok the prath is known as the dead body the people of british oak where people die\n08:53 - the body of mortality it's hovering as a as a spook as a spirit ghost there's a it's called a prayeth it's like a prayeth and its spirit is\n09:06 - hovering in that prey look where dead bodies are goals are you know shells of the dead spirits now this is a very gross state\n09:23 - for 72 hours it takes the emotional and mental and intuitional body to disengage itself from the emotional from the physical and ethereal body\n09:38 - after 72 hours people perform another ceremony the third day they come and pick up the ashes the soul enters a new stage\n09:51 - after it has worked out its grossest karmas which are closest to the physical body so at that day when they think the passing of the spirit\n10:05 - you see people come in india with many fruits or what that's so like the best he liked say you know say ice cream or like some sweets\n10:20 - or there was something so they give all that he had liked in his life they lay before him so that spirit which is there it satisfies its last desires\n10:29 - to move on from pretlow to the next called the pishachalok now the pishacha lok it stays from 10 to 13 days the 10th day is very important so for 10\n10:46 - days it stays in the subtle body of the ghost i'm not getting the exact equivalent in the english language prayed lok then it goes to peshachalok\n10:58 - then it goes to pitralok and then it goes to devlok then from develop it descends again to pitralok okay it becomes grosser again\n11:10 - it goes from devlook to pithalok to pishachalok it passes through that and then uh then it comes into a pret a living a fetus sort of astral feeds the etheric\n11:21 - body which is living in prath lok it comes into the descents to the prayed lok then then to the house of mortals the mrtillok and then it is\n11:29 - conceived by the parents after conceiving its whole after death life so when it goes to this second stage of the pishacha where it is you can say a spirit\n11:44 - or a ghost it wanders in that region and works out that subtle karma works out that subtle karma of all its passions and emotions you know in that look where\n12:03 - it meets its like people or there is war and hatred those things are exchanged those things are dissolved and they you there are yogis who guide people through peshachalok\n12:17 - into petrolok i myself had to do it in certain occasions because the sun has to attend the the shraddha the on the tenth day of his father where the\n12:27 - son should be capable if he's a yogi he will guide the soul of his father through the maze into pithrillo into the ancestral the luna ancestors so\n12:35 - he's not reached the ancestral loki he's rich the peshachalok which is local spirits and ghosts in that they satisfy all their desires so now on the 10th day a very important\n12:49 - function is done for the soul you see these are various barriers which the soul has to break now he's in a peshachik shell he's in this body\n12:57 - that body has to break through but it does not break through till its desires of its passional and emotional and carnal desires are fulfilled in that level\n13:06 - of consciousness in that level of mind this is the life after death so what the parents or the children do of this the parent who has died or the person who has died\n13:18 - they bring all fruits and foods which they like again you know he may like chicken curry or his favorite dish maybe\n13:32 - a fried fish fish and chips so whatever they are they have to bring those to satisfy the desire okay so then this pishacha the soul covered by the pishachik shell\n13:44 - covered by the passional and emotional shell the grosser emotional and passionate shell is satisfied but before this let me mention in india\n13:56 - they have a process of shraddha and on the tenth day a shraddha is done for the pithras as well as this particular soul who is about to join from praitlok to\n14:09 - pishachalok to pithralok now the pitra are our lunar ancestors all of our fathers who have gone before us either normally or in robes of light if\n14:17 - they were enlightened a prayer is done and pinders are made pinda means a circular formed like a risotto it's it's a it's a round piece of rice\n14:34 - those rice is kept the pinned the shraddha is done on the pinned made of rice so these functions of the brahmins are to release the soul\n14:45 - from its limited passional and emotional consciousness to get it into a state of mental consciousness so when that puja is done the shell\n14:55 - breaks now there is a very peculiar thing that the life after death when the soul is in the state of the pishacha or the\n15:04 - ghost the spirit they put this prayer the puja outside they put it outside the burning hearts there are many crows there\n15:16 - a crow is supposed to be a very an indicator of a lot of spiritual knowledge because they say in our ancient scriptures there was also the immortal\n15:24 - crow called kak he's written that he was supposed to be a a great spiritual figure and he could take form of man also\n15:35 - and he restarted he recited one of the best prayers and praise of lord shiva he's supposed to live through the ages and the cycles and immortal being now the crow is there so\n15:49 - they put this rice with the food and this spinned outside and all the people who are attending the funeral ceremony\n16:02 - the tenth day after the funeral they attend this because by now the soul is mature enough and has satisfied its desires to move on to the next stage from the\n16:11 - stage of the ghost to the stage of the the lunar ancestors so they wait if the crowd eats from the rice and touches it the soul's desires\n16:22 - are fulfilled this is a sanketh an indicator and the shell breaks and the soul is relieved from its limited sphere of passional emotions it\n16:34 - goes to pure emotional mind it expands into pittrelok that is the luna ancestors this is all from india it is also taken from us and mentioned in later\n16:46 - the the book of the bardo tadal the book of the dead but it's all originally knowledge from india so but if the crow does not touch\n16:58 - then you have to wait then you have to wait and pray for it to come if it doesn't then there are some fruits there are some\n17:10 - edibles which we liked through the most liked edible we must ask him what is your desire then one person who has the intuition either one of\n17:20 - the the men will get the intuition and he'll give them what he likes he eats that then he touches it if he does not if he does not touch it then the people after some time go\n17:32 - home to their homes after finishing the prayer of the shraddha circumstances will create be created such till that time that soul will mark time\n17:41 - in limbo of the peshachalok in the limbo till he gets that desire fulfilled and they say that the pishacha can enter the bodies of people can go through them they can enter the\n17:54 - body of a cow and eat the thing they like through the cow enter the body of a man or a woman and fulfill their desires to them sometimes you see\n18:01 - that desires are filled some innocent people come from foreign countries so they what they do is that they perform prayers to the goddess\n18:11 - of some pishachik person whose desires are not filled who may be a relative they put it into that person that person is possessed\n18:23 - and his voice becomes like that person right you understand what i'm saying and that bishop fulfills his desires through that person and then when his desires are fulfilled it leaves them\n18:35 - and goes away or the satguru comes and then he just knocks it off it has happened people have had experience of this therefore it is necessary so nothing to\n18:45 - worry about you are all safe in safe hands no problem so now after the tenth day there's still a lingering of the\n18:58 - the pishacha look the soul is still in the thing of spirits then on the 13th day we all get together and the soul progresses\n19:08 - by three days after the tenth day it would have more or less fulfilled its desires by either going into a person fulfilling its desire having\n19:18 - circumstances which satisfies and then moves on to the highest fear of pitrello now this pithrill oak is our the sphere of our ancestors so from bhurlok it has moved on to\n19:35 - bhuvar the bhuvar so earth astral and deva divine so the so the terrestrial astral and\n19:52 - celestial divine is above that so now it is in the astral there it remains till it fulfills a lot of its karmas till it undergoes\n20:06 - its dues of reward and punishment even in that state it does not sit idly it's an evolutionary process after part of the karma some new sanchita karma has to be settled some\n20:20 - dna has to be changed some old karma has to be worked on and it has to prepare to take on new karma which it does on the descending arc not on the ascending\n20:29 - it's ascending now towards dave loke so it's just giving away and it's it's uh getting rid of its negative karma so he is now in the astral the soul is in the astral sphere\n20:39 - the sphere of dreams the sphere of dreams the sphere of imagination it's a very beautiful world for practically most of the dark wars\n20:49 - most of the ugly stuff is finished but still in the initial stages even of pithrill oak there are certain enmities there are certain differences to be resolved\n20:58 - these differences are resolved the bitterness and bad blood is made even everything is nullified and gradually as it gets pure it goes on to its good karma after it\n21:09 - finishes with its bad karma it goes on to its good karma and in the astral sphere the pitras he joins the ancestors so the soul that goes from here joins\n21:20 - his ancestors it's not like they believe i don't know in other religions they believe that after death and karma there's nothing you don't live\n21:28 - indians don't do that they have the intuition to perceive that the soul lives on in spite of its casting its physical body\n21:36 - then its passional body then it casts its emotional body and then it goes into this divine body in devlop in the heavenly spheres so there's the\n21:46 - earth the intermediary state and the heavenly sphere this is the journey of the soul we have now reached the journey to the astral state in this state when\n21:56 - the bad karmas are over and everything is getting better it gets the reward for its good karma gets the reward for its good karma it starts getting its reward\n22:10 - and it starts meditating it starts joining its other ancestors and all the time year after year on earth the indian people do this ceremony of\n22:20 - shraddha every time on the tenth day the shradd is done there's a particular day you know where you\n22:29 - with which is called the pitra pandra the pitra paksha so this paksha of petra paksha is 15 days dedicated to the ancestors where all the people pray to your\n22:41 - ancestors to get this so this knowledge spread not only to tibet and to china but also to japan they also do ancestral worship you ask them for the source of where\n22:50 - they got it they point to india so we need to set things right and know where the source is the ancient rishis discovered this in india\n23:03 - so as the soul evolves the people below are praying for the evolution of its soul and for the peace of its ancestors they perform this puja called the shraddha\n23:16 - the shraddha ceremony and if there are any people who have died by accident if there any people who have intense desires left or who have enmity between one another\n23:26 - they go to sacred places like kashi vishwanath in banyan banaras or they go to thrambakeshwar where they do the shradd the ceremony for the ancestors\n23:37 - if if somebody has murdered someone or there's been a death or premature death they do a very special type of shraddha called the narayan nag bali the narayan nagabali is done just beyond\n23:50 - nasik there's one of the bhara jyotir lingas of shiva which is called trimbakeshwar there the narayan nag bali is done\n24:00 - this is a very important shrad and it it frees you from the kaal sarpa yoga the the evil effects of rahu and ketu in your horoscope\n24:10 - and the dragon of evil is is destroyed and for you and for your ancestors this is not only the belief of the people of sanatana dharma in\n24:19 - india in aryabharta but this is a fact and i have had first-hand experience when i was doing the shraddha of nara and nagbali my ancestors actually in\n24:30 - physical form came down there were three ladies and one man and i recognized those three ladies two of them as my aunts and i could\n24:38 - recognize them this is this this is this this is this and they started laughing they said we have come to the yogi he is bound to know us i said whatever form you take i\n24:46 - know who you are so i say thank you for coming my prayers have been answered and your desires have been fulfilled now go in peace\n24:54 - but they were my aunts but i had to bless them because i was in the at shiva's place so the power of shiva was within me so that when the noor is within you then\n25:05 - nobody is the father and nobody is the mother and that is that is the the light given to you by mahadeva he kills you and saves you at the same\n25:31 - time so what does he kill takes the snake slow and pulls it out he kills the the skin of the snake and pulls the fresh one out\n25:40 - so what is the work of shiva in all this these are very small states for shiva to even look you may not even know what's happening it's just by its grace these things are\n25:49 - happening so when you do this nara nagabali not only you but your ancestors are free from all their past crimes and sins and negativities\n25:59 - now after the shradd is done year by year the soul evolves and ultimately from the state of petra in the astral sphere it goes into om swaha the third heaven\n26:18 - third stage which is swarglok so from from pithralok he goes to devlok this is the the life after death of the soul the soul is living all the time\n26:33 - it is this life so life after death of the physical body life after death of the passional body life after death of the emotional body\n26:44 - life after death of the mental body and life after death of the intuitional body which usually does not go but is carried on because it forms\n26:56 - the very soul itself which incarnates it goes into their look deva the shining ones the gods you see so when an indian yogi tells you that if you do this mantra this coverage\n27:12 - not even the gods can defeat you and you can defeat the gods it is these gods they are referring to the semi divine beings semi-divine\n27:22 - beings do you understand so when you go to devlop you have now only your pure karma to enjoy the fruits of your good deeds\n27:34 - your good karma to enjoy to take in a veil of and here the soul does rest and in this state if if you are graceful the great yogis and rishis like swami\n27:48 - sri yukteshwar giri and shirdi sai baba and sham zatha brzee and you know all these great saints they can come and they can visit you there and they\n28:00 - can bless you in but they have to come down because they're still in in that you can go into states of samadhi but they are in nirvikalpa samadhi so\n28:10 - they they descend they don't condescend they descend with compassion to love you and to serve you and then you get into your state\n28:22 - then you enjoy a peaceful life you're in the heavenly gardens of zanat and you're roaming around and you have all the time in the world to meditate maybe there are temptations there maybe\n28:36 - they are not because that is the heavenly sphere because indran is retinue and all the apsaras and the and all the people are in\n28:48 - this this the heavenly sphere so when the soul gets there it works out whatever it has to work out its karma it enjoys\n28:59 - the benefits of its good karma it reaps the fruits of its good karma and beats all the people there now after it meets the people there and it's\n29:14 - karma's it is always in that perpetual state around it there's a certain soft energy which protects it you see people over here they don't know\n29:24 - they complained of a soft energy protecting them the energy of guru natal you all must be seeing it around you over here if you think of me or if you're there near the sad guru a gentle\n29:35 - energy will come and be like a protection you can all feel that but sometimes it comes boom because that's me i'm not gentle is not\n29:44 - my nature you see like i'm boom now we are continuing the topic of life after death as i have told you again this is taken\n29:60 - from the shraddha ceremony of the ancient brahmanas and seers and sages the life after death is also in a peculiar way described in the book of india called garuda purana\n30:15 - i am detailing it to you as i have perceived and experienced and of what i know now we have come so far the life after death when the soul dies\n30:27 - and leaves the physical body it goes to a more expanded state of prath-loke which is the land of the dead the goals and the spirits\n30:38 - the graveyards it stays there for three days after that it gets refined and passes into the next sphere which is the peshachalok which is the lower\n30:50 - and the lower astral sphere of pisachalok the passional sphere after that the shell of the passional body of the soul is broken\n31:00 - and it goes into the emotional sphere and the mental sphere of the body which is called a pithralok so from prathlok it goes to peshachalok from peshachalok it goes to pithrilloq\n31:13 - in the astral sphere after it finishes with the astral sphere bhur is the lowest the earth british then bhuvar is the as is the intermediate state\n31:25 - the passionate sphere the astral sphere where the soul goes in pithralok and swaha is swargalok or dev lok so the pitra now enters the dev lok\n31:39 - the third heaven where it enjoys and reaps the benefits of its good karma which it performed on earth and it also gets the benefits and\n31:53 - rewards of its good deeds this is as fear as i have repeated as i have said before and i repeat again where you meet all your pitras your luna and sisters\n32:08 - the saints and sages who are in your family and also if you are blessed with good karma as you reside in devlope the heavenly sphere\n32:18 - saints and sages like lord krishna the christ shirdi sai baba sham zitha brzee and all other great saints will come and visit you and bless you it\n32:29 - is an ideal place but many people do not continue their meditation in this sphere they tend to enjoy and reap the fruits of their good karma in dev\n32:40 - lok so therefore they are bathing in luxurious champagne fountains and they're going by the beautiful hillside and seeing the multicolored\n32:48 - lights and sunsets the beautiful birds flying with astral colors and wings and fainting hues of perfume so sweet that you will faint\n32:59 - so heaven is a very beautiful place so of course in one of my poems i have described one of the higher heavenly spheres and some of the heavenly spears and the\n33:16 - yogi says yogi says i belong i am a stranger to this land to the earth i belong to that land where there is no life no death\n33:40 - so this is not the swar glock i'm sorry it's not developed it's a much higher plane maybe tapa satya or some look like that and he says where there is no gentleman\n33:50 - no life and death [Music] no life or death so he says all the twelve seasons of the month i am drunk\n34:08 - i am drunk with the wine of the lord with the eternal abe hayat okay and there he says in this land there is no ego the ego is death\n34:23 - only the divine remains so it's definitely satya loki it is it's not it's a higher state but at a lower state where there is ego and there is still mortality there you\n34:33 - still have to reincarnate in that state there is no reincarnation that reincarnation is by choice of the liberated soul this reincarnation is true compulsion we get back to the\n34:42 - swargalok after swarglok then the soul gets ready because it has finished its bad and good karma and it has finished its justice which is to be meted out\n35:01 - in the life after death it has reached the pinnacle of the ascending ark the small ascending ark now from that point it gets its new\n35:14 - prarabdha karma a new set of prada the karmas for the new life and also added to it is the unfulfilled desires of its past life which should have gone\n35:25 - but which are still there in the collective subconscious of many other past lives so that is given to it to work out so this new set of prada the karmas the\n35:38 - soul will come with now what happens when the soul enters into swargalok it gets its first prarab the karma which is very subtle\n35:47 - the soul has become clear light now then it is again quoted for reincarnation with a subtle desire the first karma that desire which comes in his thing as atmakarak\n36:00 - the planet which determines why he is born that is his seeking for god anything which is to do with devotional music\n36:10 - with meditation with search for god because he's not liberated he's not gone up you see they there are ombu so we had the cyclist\n36:25 - but then the biggest cycle where you liberated us so he's only in the small cycle of liberation so then he gets his desire again\n36:42 - to meditate the soul is again coated with a subtle desire and pure desires to sing the praises of god to meditate to sit quietly\n36:55 - during the sunrise and be absorbed in the sun these pure thoughts pure words and pure deeds that karma is layered on to the soul\n37:05 - the balsam of pure karma is put around the soul for its next incarnation so now he is descending and he is now incarnating with the subtle layer\n37:18 - of karma and from dev devloak he begins to be absorbed in that which is given to him be absorbed in that meditation\n37:32 - in that setting in that preferring the silence and the purity and as the soul lives in that place again determined by the intensity of that karma which is laid on he\n37:47 - carries on in heaven because that is a part of his good karma to be actively experienced but at this stage he just is that feeling of calmness\n38:01 - then the soul again begins to descend from swargalok it makes an entry by the time it's a very interesting phenomena to notice some\n38:15 - parents somewhere in the world two couples are meditating and praying for a good soul they are meditating because at the young parents\n38:30 - it is the nature of women to meditate for a child they are made like that and this this age from 20 20 to 40 or 20 to 38\n38:45 - where they want a child every woman has been through that stage and they want somebody like krishna or christ or shams nobody wants a rasputin is it\n38:56 - nobody wants a dare oh shaytan shaytan shaytan nobody is doing that jumper okay no woman wants a rascal rascal rascal nobody wants a rascal okay but sometimes\n39:08 - when a rascal is born he turns out to be a very good guy they say when a child is a rascal when he's small he grows up to be a very mighty guy yeah all these fellows the\n39:17 - great warriors and world shakers and famous men were very naughty when they were young you see all these examples like napoleon also robert clive or\n39:28 - you know chingish khan or chhatrapati shivaji or maharana pratap when they were young they were doing very risky things and disobeying in their bravery also they were doing a\n39:38 - rascality because they were not obedient because they their fire was burning with courage and they knew they their courage knew no limits so in that stage\n39:49 - this child is being born and taking that particular karma those particular parents who we know not what according to the the solar or karmic jigsaw\n40:00 - some child will fit the womb of some mother right so they are preparing very few of them this soul depending on whether it's a high soul in the next\n40:10 - life or medium solo low soul will go to that particular parents who are high medium or low that is the law of karma so after that this soul in swag loki enters\n40:24 - so in this bardot state into the next lower he comes down into a lower sphere ready to incarnate as he's coming to the lower sphere\n40:36 - he's still finishing with his good karma he's doing his is he's still enjoying his good karma his astral karma the bad karma have more or less gone on the first\n40:47 - ascending off by descending with his good karma at both the the bhur bhaswa at the heavenly sphere astral sphere and terrestrial celestial\n40:60 - astral and terrestrial sphere so when it comes to the the astral sphere like his spiritual or heavenly body made of swargalok particles was built\n41:19 - his astral body begins to be built after his mental body is built then his astral body begins to take shape after he has finished his\n41:30 - his karma in the karma is still operating in these three spheres after you get a different type set of karma mahajana tapas\n41:43 - when he comes to the astral sphere it is very interesting to note that his body takes on the next layer of the matter of the astral sphere\n41:55 - from the celestial he comes to the astral and in the astral sphere like he finished with his bad karma he is now reaping his good astral karma\n42:05 - meeting pleasant people seeing to his success his the frame of his mind how his lifestyle is what his mindset will be all this is\n42:15 - formed in the return downward arc to the of the soul now the the soul is coming downwards why it is coming down to earth on the terrestrial sphere from the astral to\n42:25 - the terrestrial it's coming down from the celestial sphere to the astral sphere from the asteroid to the terrestrial sphere and then entering the womb of a mother\n42:33 - which will afford it the best fits facilities for its growth and to work out its next set of prarabdha karma the karma which is given to it for this next life\n42:46 - and so the soul descends in the astral sphere it works out it's good in the astral sphere all the karma that is there and it gets its business contacts it gets\n42:58 - its good contacts it gets good health good diet good eating habits all these things are studied and learned in the astral sphere then from the astral sphere after having\n43:12 - done that it enters the subtle etheric level of the physical the terrestrial region now the terrestrial region it has come very\n43:21 - close to being reincarnated again and that in its subtle lower astral body or subtle physical body which is called the ethereal\n43:31 - the ethereal body it is in search for the proper type of womb of that mother and that type of a parent so that means the soul the spirit of\n43:45 - that soul will animate the sperm of the father to be it will start animating it at the etheric level in the physical sphere\n43:56 - the sperm of the father to be and the over the egg of the mother-to-be the spirit will pass breeze through it it will breeze through the sperm over\n44:06 - then when they unite the sperm of the father and the over the egg of the mother the zygote is formed zygote is the first conception so the soul\n44:21 - comes back after life it is reincarnated again this is the afterlife journey of the soul through all the spheres\n44:40 - it comes back to earth and that zygote is formed in the womb of the mother this is the life after death of the soul which i have told you this is an education which people are\n44:53 - not given today in these times which they must be given because it is not explicitly explained in all the books this is very very important\n45:02 - that this be transcribed and printed out and given to each mother to know what should be done now i'm coming to the most important part of this\n45:13 - the third part what should be done so when the mother has the zygote that time she should meditate and pray if she is a meditating mother the soul is already meditative\n45:27 - augmented but some mothers may not be meditated they may be musical but that soul is seen from before and electromagnetically it is it is a\n45:38 - musician itself attracted itself to the womb of a musical mother of music loving parents so they get the facilities for its growth another may be an engineer\n45:47 - so those souls usually come like that you see unless for karmic reasons a soul comes to take revenge upon its parents you see you see a son tormenting his\n45:56 - parents there are many permutation combinations to this i'm just giving you the ideal permutation combination right so it comes and then they the first\n46:06 - trimester natal prenatal there is also a technique of bringing the soul into birth parents of a soul who want a\n46:17 - divine soul they meditate nine months before the soul is born so the parents the first trimester nine eight seventh month they form\n46:32 - and call this prepare pure matter in their mind in the mental sphere in the dev look for the soul to come saying come then in the second trimester 654\n46:46 - there's the astral the emotions the music you know from the mental the dev look to the astral look the music the devotion the chant then when they are three\n46:57 - months left on the terrestrial sphere they take the proper diet they do the proper exercise nothing has been done now they have not been together they have not conceived\n47:06 - they are just parents this is called prenatal parenting before the child is born they are parenting the soul so prenatal parenting is done before the soul is born\n47:18 - after this when the one month is left then on the particular day again where the soul enters from that side conceives from this side the house is ready\n47:30 - this side the man and woman get together sperm and over unite to form the zygote that soul which is ready for this type of house in zygote enters and conception is formed and the\n47:42 - cycle of uh of birth and rebirth is completed so this is this is the whole mystery of life and death the soul never dies and you should\n47:54 - prepare for this child then when the child is in then also first trimester second time is the third trimester she meditates on the grass of physical\n48:02 - form and the diet the food then she goes to emotional and devotional and then she goes to meditation in the seventh eighth and ninth month like this\n48:12 - so then the child and then there's post-natal parenting so the child is never leaving the mother prenatal natal postnatal parenting then you get the divine child this is\n48:23 - how it is done and all young people should know of this this is a great education which is lacking not only over here so much but all over the world\n48:32 - it's in education so it is the art and the sacred uh performing art of producing spiritual children of invoking them in the womb of the mother in the is-ness\n48:44 - of the father now we get to the third point what is the situation of a yogi and all this terrestrial sphere the afterlife\n49:00 - of the soul life after death of the soul now when the yogi sits to meditation he is already a complete being he is not in the cycle of birth and\n49:11 - death burba swahili puna repeat he is not in that cycle of birth and death so the answer to the yogi for the book\n49:22 - of the book of the dead for the bardo tolent to the tibetan the yogi tells him that the yogi catches the bhar dutal\n49:31 - the life and death by the fallock and throws it out of the window the yogi in this very life he works out all his karma his life and his death his life after\n49:42 - death is worked out in his meditation in this life and that's what you all are doing that your life after death also is being worked out because you're going at such\n49:49 - a rapid speed that only not only your prayer of the karma will finish other karmas of other life have to be given to you because you're burning it\n49:57 - up like an inferno you're incinerating all the evil and all the karma you live for god alone you live for god you die for god you see god hear god breathe god\n50:09 - taste god touch god live god die god god god god god god god god god god god that's the yogi power excellence and so when the yogi is meditating\n50:30 - death will come to him but before that he has worked out his karma he doesn't have to go to the pishachi lok or the prath lok or the pitre lok because he's beyond the\n50:40 - pithloak and beyond devlop also the devas come to him and very great yogis are told can you help us out with this because we are stuck there\n50:50 - in the dev lok who knows perhaps i don't know whether i should say this it's about vishwamitra and and mainka and indra\n51:02 - so even indra could not defeat the purpose of viswamitra to reach the final goal and make a heaven on his own and surpass indra it was indra who was stuck\n51:12 - with menka not vishwamitra he carried on although she was a an afsarah and a goddess she had the power in the spark of parvati\n51:22 - and from herb was born shakuntala the daughter who gave birth to bharat after who the land of india is named so viswamitra is the great grand sire of\n51:34 - of the land of aryabratvarta of the aryan root race of which we all belong to and the new civilization or new root race we say civilization\n51:48 - is the savani root race which is to be formed 500 years hence so when the yogi meditates he does not go through this all the spheres of swahili does not go\n52:01 - through pishachi lok he does not go through pretlok pishachalo pitra lok and dev lok he directly transcends these states he works out\n52:13 - all the life after death and all his karmas i'm not talking about a perfected yogi i'm talking about practitioning yogis like you they work it out\n52:22 - in life in their very consciousness in not life after death life before death he works out his bardo experience his devachan experience his astral and luna and sisters experience of that\n52:37 - sphere in this very life he catches the bardo the devachant he catches the life after death and throws it out of the window\n52:47 - because he is living always and he cannot die when he leaves his body he is still conscious there is a conscious exit out from his body this is a very important factor to\n52:57 - know because the speed of the yogis evolution the speed of his evolution is done by his consciousness moving through the spine\n53:06 - he has awakened his kundalini and therefore his stars stand aside and say oh yogi fearless bold your light between the eyebrows hold he says that you can this is called\n53:22 - taking the kingdom of heaven by storm this is a very important thing that when yogis do not go through this process of life after death they are all already immortalized in\n53:32 - this during life in this life that's why kriya yoga is called the lightning path you",

          "transcript": "00:05 - [Music] [Question] I've heard a lot about\n2012 and the upcoming years, all the things being said about kundalini energy moving from\none part of the planet to the other. I'd be interested in your perception.[Gurunath's\nAnswer] You see 2012 is the year, from actually I'd put it from 2008 to 2012. So now where\nyou're sitting listening to me, you don't know who you're listening to and I don't know\nwho I'm talking to [laughter] You know both\n00:57 - of us may be somebody who has to play a great\npart in 2012. Who knows. Aye? All of you may play a great part, I see a lot of loving souls,\na lot of great souls here you may have to play a great part. Aye? Aye. Don't be feeble\nfor righteous work [laughter] Be bold otherwise how will you override the terrorists. You've\ngot to be as strong as them. Be strong in righteous purpose. okay, so this starts...\nthey say the incoming surge is in many facets.\n01:40 - This is just one of the minor facets of the\ngreat evolution which is designed in the great cosmic order of the great Shiva Goraksha Babaji,\nSanata Kumar and Kalki Maitreya, the Christ. They work for the redemption of Human kind\nnot only by sending out love and peace vibrations but this time, the soot on the lamp glass\nof the disciple is too much. The soot on the lamp glass of the disciple is too much. So\nhence they come to clear the soot by direct\n02:24 - means of annihilating this negativity. I don't\nknow whether this negativity is just limited to the intellect, the mind, the emotions or\nthe physical body or all of it. If He should swipe us off in one shot, we just get a new\nmindset and a new body. That's all about, when Kalki comes, riding on a white horse\nwith a meteor as his sword. He will erase the negativity from this world. Now whether\nHe will erase it from the physical bodies\n03:02 - and the minds and emotions of the people\nor just from the emotions and the negative mind is a question to be seen. But these people,\nworking on the intellect, Kalki Maitreya works on the Ananda-maya-Kosha, the intuition. And\nShiva Goraksha Babaji, Sanata Kumar works on the Atma, that is the spirit. That is,\nthe spiritual soul, and the intellect. Now from 2008 to 2012, this is their mystery,\nthis is their work. There are two ways they\n03:41 - will work in. They will enter first the bodies\nof 144, one thousand and fourty four as they say right? Is that the number you gave me?\nRight? 144 chosen and selected people, 144,000 selected and chosen people. Right? 1 million\nand fourty four chosen and selected people. 1 billion and fourty four million chosen and\nselected people. Gradually filtering the spirit of righteous consciousness into the souls\nof all of you who are sitting here. From 144\n04:29 - to a billion and fourty four million. One\nthousand and fourty four hundred to a million and fourty four thousand to a billion and\nfourty four million. All these people will be infused with the spirit of Shiva as Goraksha\nand Vishnu as Kalki Maitreya. Now after they are infused in us, how will they infuse into\nthe practice of Kundalini Kriya Yoga? They will enter you and make you servers of humanity\nwhere you serve humanity as their larger self.\n05:12 - Aye? Aye. So this is what is going to happen\nen masse from 2008 to 2012. Aye? Aye. Then a certain special aspect of being, who is\ndeputed [to appoint or authorize as an agent] by Kalki and who is deputed by Shiva Goraksha\nBabaji shall come to earth and set things right after the great so called Holocaust,\nso called World War. I don't think there will actually be a world war but a world war like\nsituation, very nearly a world war. Then shall\n05:47 - peace reign. So this will happen after 2011,\n2012 and towards the end of 2012. And so he shall both come en mass as your breath and\nsoul and they shall also come individually. The Kalki Maitreya and Shiva Goraksha Babaji.\nHave I made myself sufficiently clear? Look for yourself. Look for him within the practice\nof your own Kriya Yoga. Do not miss the opportunity to practice the Kriya Yoga, in the here now\nTruth alive. Aye.",

          "transcript": "00:00 - ah ah aha but as a safe course you know it's a very beautiful st. mr. safe never take\n00:40 - things by the outward show means never date things by the packaging they always go for the packaging will never take things by the outward show for the fennel flies high but the fern dies no\n00:57 - remember I see and this is where we're we are always deceived I'm going to bookstores I go here and I go there and beautiful packaging of books and CDs and videos and you open it and read it\n01:10 - nothing you're going to bring two books with two different packages what the both the books say both the books are saying hickory dickory dock.the mouse ran up the clock the clock struck one\n01:28 - the mouse ran down hickory dickory dock and then the buyer of the book says Tam I went to the packaging and I blew it up I'm amazed it's wasted money so if you go to the packaging if you go to the\n01:44 - output show that's what they say in a manipulative me Oh gonna knock your books in or they should have a shrink wrap you should have this wrap they should have that because in America is\n01:53 - all about packaging and what I'm trying to tell you it's all not about packaging it's not about packaging if it were all about the outward show it would be better than I said to my clothes and I\n02:10 - remained inside and said to my clothes you know the example about Bernard Shaw he went very sharply dressed and casually dressed for people in a fire Society said oh what a shiny man and\n02:20 - what a mistake she was going to a party next time so he sent this shoe is smooth and a spare of ties he said this is what you're worth take it you don't want the true man you go for outward show you get\n02:31 - the outward show and that's what will happen in spirituality but getting back to the point the rapid industrial evolution pushed the human machine to the limits\n02:45 - announced the digital revolution the electronic revolution the computer revolution of course you feel that one computer can do the work of 10 men but then you also work 10 times harder so\n03:04 - you're back to square one now this Industrial Revolution pushes the human being to its limits of work and the only thing is that they they cannot tell when to switch off when to stop and then\n03:22 - those people who keep working on on the computer and they do not know when to stop I believe such people of all nerves so this nerdiness will be readiness will be the cause of your own undoing it\n03:45 - won't be nerdy go upon a burning trip so this this has to be stopped this deadline meeting of the deadlines this is a major factor which alienated\n04:06 - the human being from nature the rapid industrial development is one of the main causes which stressed you so much that you could not know how to pull you have to know how the pole and people\n04:29 - keep working for money keep working for money and they are so mine's so wise that they work for their own day as though this was not enough they work hard for it so all these things bring\n04:46 - aware and day to the human being and I think it's really not worth it at the end of the day at the end of life you say what am i it's probably the top nations are sacked me and sucked me dry\n04:56 - we have vice presidents at senior people you are not sure they realize this thing that they take so much of a dollar you so much of at all that they forget that essentially the human soul the human\n05:10 - being has to have a self-esteem and B respectively and every time you have to be a deadline in this rapid industrial revolution every time you meet a deadline you die little by little add to\n05:30 - your truer self so meeting the deadline is very very a destructive thing if you know what the tension of meeting a deadline start your work well before B in time now thousands of people have\n05:52 - taken to the science of rhythmic breathing to go with the heavy onslaught at the which you have mined up with if the industries this heavy well because time\n06:07 - has become the demon monster time has become the demon monster which is giving you essential hypertension of unknown cause because of this demon time and\n06:18 - industrial deadline it's giving you as mom from Qaeda's ulcers due to tension and heavy one all these psychosomatic disorders are the gift of the modern age the gift of\n06:37 - industry and application to you all these cycles of I think they suffer us you know you have this sneezing you have allergy you have ulcers that's that unites up with the partner is promises\n06:52 - that's the big Christmas gift you get the promises and you're in oh you need a bypass so not saying you should know well you have to look after yourself and be aware and Kriya yoga is the means\n07:05 - Kriya Yoga is the way it shows you to soothe the nerves and calm the mind try it out for yourself and feel the difference I'm not saying believe me try it out for\n07:20 - yourselves and feel the difference it will soothe your nerves and calm your mind so Kriya yoga teaches you to cope with the world that you find in the rough and\n07:37 - tumble of daily life therefore I strongly suggest you and strongly make this appeal that before it's too late practice this science of the breath called\n07:56 - Priya you ah ah ah",

should be careful at that stage don&#39;t be too proud that you are higher than the power of the angels for you can still have a fall because you are Immortal at that stage but you are not Divine you\n03:58 - are not divinely realized the world is from me I am not born of the creation and the world the world is born from me see the\n04:16 - similarity in the poem The World Is sit the world is born from me his Consciousness is expanding more and more with every\n04:28 - verse Jam jadam Adam means incoming breath and jadam means Pras the world is from me not me from the world the incoming of the world&#39;s breath and the outgoing is of the\n04:50 - world&#39;s breath is my breath I mean that&#39;s a tall statement right but the yogi has said it that is the biggest Temptation you&#39;re playing\n05:14 - God so even that playing God is a big Temptation you say no I don&#39;t want this even this is matter at its subtlest film when you realize this third state of the poem where you real you realize all of\n05:28 - this is me in that I showed her all of this is me in that dream but if you fall for that you stay at that and if you if you try to push it and challenge the Supreme then you get\n05:44 - the answer of narim and hu so this is the third verse where you become the prur I am the Sun the moon the stars and the Beast there&#39;s all of this is me but\n06:00 - if you look through it and say oh Lord I don&#39;t even want all of this is me if this is the ultimate state of creation and the final state of perfection in relativity I don&#39;t want\n06:16 - relativity I don&#39;t want even Enlightenment with Beyond relativity when you when you are relieved of even the desire for Rel Enlightenment and even the desire for all this power of\n06:28 - eyess in which you are the cosmic ego when you dissolve that then you enter the final State the fourth stage the he says in\n06:48 - humility without ego oress this is the first stage this is the stage all of you will reach but but in our normal humility as human beings we are so little and he is\n07:11 - so vast oh Lord thy love and generosity is so much that you not only give me your D you make me you it&#39;s crazy God don&#39;t do that you\n07:24 - make me you and then he says I am more than what you think me to be thinking is not there the right is not yours to choose you have to become\n07:43 - me because you are me you are evolving towards me so this is a beautiful poem which is describing the Supra conscious states of samadhi till the ultimate stage the J expands\n07:59 - verse by verse till it merges into [Applause] Shiva so here you become aware of your awareness and in that awareness that humility is there yes between the third\n08:19 - and fourth verse third is not humility because it&#39;s it&#39;s not even ego it is the facticity of things as they are that is not an ego it is the facticity of things as they are because whoever I\n08:41 - touch gets cured if I accidentally say oh you have left your life wake up he will wake up but that shouldn&#39;t give me the feeling that it&#39;s me it&#39;s the facticity of it&#39;s\n08:55 - there it is there I am surrendered to him I know only him I don&#39;t know my ego so whatever he does is me and whatever I do is heam and then even the ey is left he\n09:13 - says in all humility not for his sake not for the sake of God but for the sake to instruct humanity and his disciples the sadguru says in all humility which is a\n09:27 - facticity a fact accomplished [Music] n",

          "transcript": "00:11 - as you practice in the suari you will get into a deep state of concentration and when as you keep\n00:23 - practicing the concentration will be distracted because your thoughts will run away by the buildup of your exclusive attention your concentration will be stolen by random\n00:40 - thoughts they will run away with your composed mind but you with your willpower will pull the distracted thoughts back to the spine and breathe from the third eye down you'll breathe\n00:54 - down breathe up again it will run so the bringing back of a distracted mind to the focus of your attention which is the moving of the Flaming star is known as the practice of\n01:10 - concentration concentration is the faculty of exclusive attention like in America you say I'm going to wrap my mind around the star I somehow can't wrap my mind around\n01:28 - the star that I am my mind is running too many errands so to prevent that use volution as you go deeper and deeper from the sush you get into a state of or\n01:41 - meditation where the Mind runs no more its errs but is focused on the Flaming star in the spine this is the technique I'm just giving you I'm describing the technique pay attention don't breathe\n01:52 - 100% attention breath slows down don't even let your thoughts go away from me focus on me give me 200% attention a normal human being has a very good concentrated person has 33%\n02:05 - attention that's the highest degree of attention when you transcend that you're going into samadi but anyway from the sura Nadi you go to the next Nar which is\n02:14 - called the vajra Nadi the lightning path in that your concentration is transformed into a faculty called meditation where there's a constant flow of thought it does not get distracted it\n02:25 - does not run to the to the supermarket or the stores it remains focused in the spine that is the faculty of meditation the\n02:39 - river becomes an SV and as you practice deeper and deeper night and day persevering on moving of the star constantly repetition never mind if you get bored keep focusing on\n02:52 - the Flaming star then your con your meditation enters a different dimension of the old otion and it enters a subtler psychic Dimension a psychic nerve called the chitra Chini and you\n03:10 - are then you have passed from the state of concentration to meditation and when it enters the chitrar you have enter the state what is called sap samadi the samadi with\n03:23 - vulas with cognition with name and form and as you keep practicing undaunted with many difficulties to face throughout the years 10 years 20\n03:39 - years 30 years 40 years talking about lifetime for one life two life 10 lives Americans are not used to this one life they ask me how many minutes will I get enlightened in how many how many work\n03:51 - they say how many work hours there are I said you should ask how many work lifetimes are there so you have to get used to this because no price is too great to\n04:03 - pay to embrace God I know you're constantly hugging one another here but to hug the Lord all your desires will be satisfied\n04:18 - the description so beyond words that it is utterly impossible to describe the Ecstasy worth going through the all the agony for just that one Embrace to to dissolve in him and then from the chitr\n04:33 - when you enter the final brah the the different dimension you enter from the state of samadi to the state of NP samadi where there is no\n04:46 - thought no word no deed no causation no space and time you are in the here now truth life you know why I occasionally uh shift into Sanskrit\n05:12 - without bothering to explain to you this is my technique of teaching it's not the words that I'm teaching I'm I'm shifting you from head to heart because you have no choice you cannot understand what I'm\n05:24 - saying so you try to feel the words I I so you're shifting to a higher dimension of intuition so that's my way of pushing you into from the dimension of rationale to the dimension of\n05:40 - intuition so when by practice of K yog you get into the state of the nalp samadi again you experience this Bliss of God but due to latent desires of past lives past lives you are put it back\n05:58 - again to the lake of the Divine mind you cannot remain in Divine consciousness of Nal for long that's why every single desires of your in past present and future lives unless\n06:14 - it is fulfilled you cannot go into a permanent state of nalp samadhi which is called the N be samadhi the samadhi without seed No Seeds of Desire\n06:28 - must sprout what is a samadi samadi is the Ecstasy of expanded Consciousness I'm sorry there are no\n06:41 - words in English or even in American which can explain Sam but I'm just giving you a rough sketch this is a rough cut so they realize my difficulty I cannot convey to a language so new a\n06:57 - language so ancient and therefore this Ecstasy of expanded Consciousness as you the soul sworn you fly high you take off from the lake and\n07:12 - you fly high but then again something is stuck to your leg and it pulls you back again and again from n to samadi and this goes on for many lifetimes\n07:24 - unless and until at last you sever the last link of remembered experiences a sound scar this is called a sound scar means it's a remembered experience of either this life or past life\n07:43 - [Music] [Music]",

maximum lasting joy not everlasting but the simpler it is the more lasting the more ordinary it is the more lasting so this is a skate of Ananda Samadhi which I often go into I do not know how long I\n00:51 - sit there but here in the beautiful surroundings of the ashram I am at home and by the grace of the divine he's put me in such a place where I can really you know go deeper into my true self and\n01:06 - in the outpouring serve you all as my larger set now in the stage when you carry on you go into these stages of deeper and deeper knowingness of your true self\n01:32 - but there comes a stage which I called the desert walk and everybody is meditational life there comes a period which is dry which is of long effort and ring yields no results this is what I'm\n01:48 - talking and from my experience I practiced a certain things which I'll tell you that when you go through this period of a dry meditation period where you seem to be making no progress and\n02:07 - yet you're meditating night and days what you should try is to galvanize yourself into your state of reality by saying I am the light divine there's bodies but a dream of mind I am the\n02:25 - light so that wakes you out of your bottom of the Kriya ohm and gives you a new thought to nourish and to feed your consciousness like there's one beautiful law firm which have made its ultimate\n02:44 - yogi hunter who he promised - prophecy ho hey ho chick Donaghy Nashville now see the Moroccan orange and avi nah see the Moroccan original innocence this means that in your condition in your\n03:02 - state as you are know that you or their consciousness are a traveler in this changing world of Maya you the consciousness are the same but you are traveling you are not the changing\n03:23 - states of Maya the night and day the joy and sorrow the light and dark you are the constant background of eternal peace so in the States or divine know that you are a traveler in\n03:37 - this land you are not this house of flesh and bone you're not this house of flesh and bone you have to say this to yourself you are the divine immortal consciousness they had written in\n03:54 - Nashville now cease I am NOT the body not the mind I am a lacunar engine novena feasts i am the lord of a radiant splendor if you say I'm not this physical body and mind i am the lord of\n04:05 - e radiant splendor that gives you a new push a new energy suddenly in that bottom of that constant kriya breath of meditation which everybody goes through say i am the lord of a radiant splendor\n04:17 - that gives you a new inspiration to carry on because if you are the lord which is the truth you are the spark of God you are the Lord Lord of a radiant splendor so if you say this this will\n04:33 - give you a new inspiration to move your breath of Kriya Oh with more enthusiasm and there'll be more light in your breath because some people can visualize lies light more easily\n04:50 - some people can visualize sound more easily so whatever your easiest visual is use that to uplift your consciousness of forage your consciousness or salvage your consciousness out of the tremors of\n05:07 - the century you have to salvage your consciousness but otherwise you will get stuck in the trammels of the senses and the sense objects will keep distracting you to the $0.05 telephone of sight\n05:23 - taste touch smell and sounds you have to withdraw the five cents telephones true of your motor sensory nerves by magnetizing a spine the spine will withdraw the pranic energy and that\n05:37 - pranic energy which will flow in the spine will give you the lit up five pointed star the star of your soul and as you purify your senses by the constant practice of Kriya yoga you will\n05:51 - become more and more of spirit and less and less of matter because you will be purifying your nerves your your veins your arteries your capillaries and in that purification process of Kriya\n06:05 - you'll be pumping in fresh oxygen by pranayama which will make it unnecessary for your heart to pump and your lungs to function so the heart will be rested the lungs will be rested the breath will be\n06:23 - still and the breath is the core that dies the soul to the body so by stealing the breath you can untie the cord of breath which ties your soul to the body and let your soul expand into super\n06:40 - consciousness therefore regular practice of the least 144 three hours a day is necessary otherwise all as well I'm in my states of Samadhi what can I tell you today's please be message I was told to\n06:56 - give you for your birthday today is all your people who are hearing me it's your birthday because I always take it from the point of view serving humanity as well as yourself so if you are my larger\n07:09 - self it's as much as your dawning day for spirituality as it is my dawning day for spirituality I'd like to call the birthday the dawning day for spirituality I think you like that so\n07:25 - now of my blessings are with you not only lip service blessings but you can all feel the blast of the transmissions use their transmission in your spa in your spinal cord in the Kriya breath\n07:35 -

I am the lightning truth divine I am the lightning being divine you see here when I say youth oh this thing is just a thing of language I mean both men and women so they're people who are very\n01:28 -

          "transcript": "00:02 - the only purpose of man's sergeant on this earth is to seek god yes um i'm new by the way um sometimes when i dream i know that\n00:20 - i'm dreaming i know that i'm in bed i'm consciously aware that i'm dreaming and i'm in bed and i'll say to the people in my dream you're not really here you know i'm\n00:33 - dreaming i'm in bed and i just wonder how can you be conscious that you're dreaming that you can be because everyone who dreams\n00:46 - one thing is certain okay when you all dream you know that you are you right you may not have thought of it you know that you are you when you dream you know that you had\n01:01 - a dream that you were eating alfonso mangroves okay when you get up it is the same you who were dreaming you were eating alfonso mangoes and now you have got up\n01:11 - and you you're feeling lazy to go up and brush your teeth but it's the same you right right so that that identity is not lost that identity and when you\n01:26 - know that you are you and wakingly you are you but you don't know that when you are eating alfonso mangoes you are dreaming when you know that and you are aware\n01:43 - that it's a dream so are you aware aware that when you're dreaming that it's just a dream so then that time you have touched consciousness\n01:52 - that that is a state where your mind is not going to sleep with your body if your mind goes to sleep with your body then you are in the dream but you don't lose your identity you\n02:02 - come out of that and in the morning you view yourself for brushing your teeth and getting ready for work but when you sleep and you have a dream and you know it's a dream\n02:10 - that means your mind is awake your inner soul is awake and it has it is aware that it is dreaming at the astral level so that is a good development to have so\n02:23 - you know you're dreaming and how do you say once i knew that i was dreaming and i was eating a mango and i said it's only a dream and i threw away the mango but i regretted it\n02:38 - i said oh god even if it was a dream i should have enjoyed it come on garuna give yourself a chance yeah but that's a good thing to be aware the mind is not asleep\n02:51 - in the restroom but if you go to the dreamless state that you're aware that you you're in a dreamy state then you're not in the dreamless state you are\n02:60 - the state of samadhi the awareness should last yes oh you had to wait wait a minute you had something to say so when you dream are you singing with\n03:15 - your third eye when you dream you are separate and you are seeing your imagination at work through a\n03:28 - physical process called the rem rapid eye movement and the film the film of your subconscious mind is passing through your mind's eye and you can see\n03:41 - that you're dreaming and working out certain unresolved forces karma and your soul is observing that unfilming of your actions\n03:54 - do you understand so that's a good thing the soul is going to be knowing what you see with when you leave your body what when you soul-lead your body\n04:05 - and you're looking down at your body is that the same you see with your mind's eye yes you see with your mind's eye the mind's eye is the soul\n04:16 - and the soul's eye is the spirit but not i the eyeless eye okay yes last night i had a dream where i was given a\n04:33 - clear message in a very everyday type way to contact all of us and i woke up saying your name i'm wondering if you could give me some\n04:45 - guidance what this could mean what guidance do you want me to give you for your dream what guidance do you want you can take the guidance from me i'll give you my\n04:60 - own guidance why should i give you your dreams guidance see we are a dream within a dream within a dream and the whole purpose of life is to\n05:15 - break those dreams into a higher and higher state of reality so you are in a dream within a dream within a dream so when you get onto the\n05:25 - first stream you get to the astral reality you get out of the second dream you are in the causal reality and when you break the third dream\n05:34 - you're in singularity one with god like like shakespeare said this whole world's a stage and we are actors they're in that he should have said this whole\n05:48 - world is a dream and we are dreamers therein and then i would have further said oh dreamers break the dream with your breath breathe\n06:00 - with aliens and be aware of your breath like a string passes through pearls of necklaces the necklaces\n06:09 - one string passes through so let your breath be that string no matter where you go and what you dream you are still aware of that one string which connects you\n06:20 - not dream after dream but life after life a thousand bodies you may have but your spirit is the same that is called the sutra atma the string\n06:33 - soul which strings every personality of all your lives past present and futures but the same you is running through all those personalities\n06:42 - life after life night after day and day after night year after year year after year and life after life you are the same you reincarnate a thousand times but you\n06:57 - are ever the same your bodies may be different the outer quotes may be different but the inner spirit running through you is ever the same\n07:07 - and that is what you have to focus on the connecting link to that running spirit is the life force energy called the quran\n07:16 - that's why we practice kundalini fear to retain that string of consciousness and let not death rub out our memories of the past we continue in unbroken memory\n07:34 - so when you're doing kriya you have to unfilm your past life karma that's what happens yes we have three states of mind we call it\n07:54 - consciousness unconsciousness and super consciousness so when we say the through meditation we evolve evolving something from a lower state we\n08:03 - go to the higher state as you go to a subtle state of consciousness as you in other words you say you peel the layers of your mind\n08:12 - the more the layers you peel the thicker layers your evolution is like the peeling of an onion you peel off layer after layer\n08:22 - and as the it gets subtler you you get to nowhere because the center of the onion is nothing so the feeling of the layers of the mind are\n08:34 - progressive states as you refine the mind you let you let those subtle sheaths go those bodies they know there's vestures or garment\n08:46 -

          "transcript": "00:09 - if you don't do anything else and just focus on God it's enough God will do the rest I do not think anything takes priority over God whether we know him or not because every breath belongs to him\n00:24 - our existence belongs to him and if you say you have no time suppose he turned around and said I have no time today so please give him a little bit of your time don't take him for granted although\n00:37 - you can take him but we should not as a mark of deep respect and love for our Creator our preserver and our spiritual Emancipator since he gives us every moment every breath everything belongs\n00:54 - to him can we not give him one hour of our time cut out separate time and practice this that's what separates the human from the animals and the animals from the the\n01:06 - other kingdoms of life otherwise they eat enjoy have sex have children just like you and me what separates you and me from them that we make a deliberate definite process is practice a\n01:20 - scientific technique to unfold the divinity within us this is the speciality of the crown of the animal kingdom which is man of course not to say that the least cared for animal\n01:42 - species is man the worst treated animal species is man the most populated animal species is man and the most threatened and endangered species is man by man I mean man and woman the human and if we\n02:02 - are not careful and we do not take the responsibility of our own evolution in our hands we shall soon be the cause of our own undoing God has given us a common sense he has given us SATs at\n02:19 - Vivek Buddha a conscience and we must use it to the best of our purpose to evolve him to unfold the divinity that we are Vivekananda said it Jonathas shreya shuara said they said it\n02:38 - per month say Yogananda said it and many other saints like ramakrishna and All Saints Babaji has said it I wonder what he meant by saying that the only purpose of\n02:53 - man sergeant on this earth is to seek God how about botany I would horse-riding how about my little garden my flowers and how about creating\n03:14 - more children about 36 children or something how about becoming a billionaire look there's a lot of social work to do a lot of hospitals to do to build a lot of great Souls\n03:31 - you know you come and of course I we adore those people and we salute them all the people who have done the great work all over in every department building hospitals for children building\n03:45 - orphanages for the poor building good care situations and places for animals you know domestic animals and also building better facilities but America is very good at that for wildlife\n04:01 - animals you know even the wildlife has been looking after them America made a great effort to convince Japan that whaling should not be done whaling is not it's not possible because the blue\n04:15 - whale is endangered that is and of course it's important of course you must do it it's absolutely every one of us in our own little way must help in not only the human Kingdom but also the animal\n04:31 - kingdom to let them come up with us and evolve with us and try to make them come on push them to become human beings let them get on to the next stage they will in any case\n04:40 - they are not waiting for us I mean God is merciful if we cannot do anything that doesn't mean they will evolve but this is just what we can do up for ourselves\n04:49 - the greatest sacrifice we can do is for ourselves as Vivekanand says giving charity to others helping others that nothing changes in the world we evolve it's paradox but in spite of that they\n05:05 - say that the only purpose of man sahjhan on this earth is to seek God my God my God and your God is well Oh Lord God I can't sit finish a thousand years of meditation in one day but that's what we\n05:28 - should do we have to intensify it so much so God is infinite as much as you can do is always little is always little as when Indian yogi had said when a co ki meditators like your hair is on fire\n05:48 - some people have taken this not yogi is saying and they they mentioned it in the in some Parliament news or some way of something like that in America didn't quote the source but I know that it's a\n06:02 - source of a naughty oaky it said that this is the way you should meditate as your hair is on fire of course the younger boys wouldn't say your hair is on fire they'll say\n06:13 - meditate as though you're on fire but but that's all you've got to go for it you got to go for it God is so urgent in our lives he is so important and these techniques are lightning paths you are\n06:26 - fortunate to get this techniques and I am fortunate to have served you to be able to give you this then they say what's the hurry to get to God maybe you are not an RA you can wait a hundred\n06:39 - million years icon Eagle hearts cannot wait and in spite of us doing the fast path we are human beings we are bound to earth it's human to earth some great person\n06:52 - said it's human to earth you heard that anyone heard that I'll tell you the other part which you haven't heard of it's human to earth but it's so\n07:04 - delightful you haven't heard of that but everybody likes that I sookie boring no not to her you have to focus actually by early means failing to have paid enough attention you have to keep\n07:29 - your mind focused on God the pole star this is very very important not forget it for a day not forget him for a single moment every breath your heart belongs to you and I shall burn the midnight\n07:43 - lamp not one so Lord we shall burn to midnight lamps so that we can sing thy glories in their praises the lamp of my heart is waiting walk into my heart my throne is ready you nod I may be a baker\n08:00 - a butcher a candlestick maker it doesn't matter what you are what practices your sincerity to get to your divine indwelling and everybody gets it see what is the advantage with you that you\n08:15 - have got onto the fast track by this you've got on to the very fast track and this is not me by traveling by car or plane and all if you really get going it's by rocket and faster than that it's\n08:30 - my lightning path there are no lightning path people but they rocket that plane people which takes many livestand four others may take one lifetime of a few lifetimes for you to get merged into him\n08:47 - but after you merge into God after you touch you touch his feet then how much of God you shall become I cannot say because you have to be so humble at that place wherever he puts you how much of\n09:02 - him he may so if you is up to him and not to you because there is no you left so it's a it's an exercise in futility to say that you are God how much you are of God you\n09:19 - know but we all know that we are of God and we merge into God but to say that we are actually God I think is a little bit of a pompous statement although maybe it's true maybe it's not God Only Knows\n09:38 - asked if the whole of Oprah Deepika is nothing but poverty corruption are nothing so you have to know this you have to know what the truth is and where the source comes the\n09:53 - source is Babaji Shiva rock Shivaji so you have to practice the spinal breathing this is the creme de la creme of all yogic practices is spinal breathing",

          "transcript": "00:01 - [Music] talking about the tradition of the na tradition is Tria who wrote The Av AV a part of that\n00:26 - tradition uh technically no and what is the the the T was in very high initiate of the 10th Century some say he is an incarnation of\n00:39 - Shiva some say he is a manifestation of Krishna he's a 10th 9th or 10th Century of and of a very very high stature totally liberated being we have very very scant historical reference of the\n00:55 - but uh he is very popular in the State uh where I come come from Maharashtra so they have a lot of D tradition they belong to the tradition of the red the L pujari the the red\n01:08 - padri tradition and he is one of the highest one of the highest Buddhas and he is uh uh try to channelize and liberate a sect\n01:23 - and a group of people known as the the aor the aor yogis who are indirect ly connected with the na yogis but are not the tradition of Na yogis they tried to make him the\n01:36 - guru of the na yogis but this is totally false and uh misrepresented it in the N tradition there is no tradition of theat it is Lord Shiva as Adat who is the Supreme Guru then his energy or sh known\n01:53 - as parva UD UD UD she is parva and then it comes to machendra jindra gorak and all the nine tradition of the great Immortal\n02:08 - beings the great Buddhas of compassion but he is does seem to have been connected at some time or the other but the true na yogis do not believe that he has any connction they have\n02:20 - tried to sort of put him in the tradition of Na yogis but he is not next question good I was I've always been under the impression the path of Tantra was also considered a path ofth\n02:36 - to yes it is part of Tantra is definitely a part of Enlightenment and the part of Tantra is a part where not the will is used it's very subtle the let go is used in that not the will is\n02:52 - used and uh Tantra has its aspects it has the right hand path the left hand path and the middle path the white Tantra the black Tantra\n03:06 - and the gay Tantra so Tantra is uh definitely one of the important processes of uh F Enlightenment I do not know how they understand the Tantra in in the Western\n03:23 - World here as they have had many readings they've had many uh readings and many books have been written about Tantra and many theoretical Scholars have uh written in\n03:40 - Toto in Tantra you know if you want to see that but I don't think they give the inner spirit I mean reading a tantra book from abinav Gupta will give you a totally different flavor rather than\n03:53 - read it from a translation from goog feierstein he seems to be the person who's doing a good work and giving you the outer shell that's all he can do and he's doing a good job you can't go\n04:06 - deeper for that you go to to abinav Gupta or you go to the great mahaguru of the abinav Gupta Gupta who started it it is the na yogis who started it it is machendra because before the Great\n04:19 - Master and incarnation of shes he says I salute machendra my Guru before I start this K Tantra or whatever Tantra he the rasia abinav Gupta gives I don't know whether\n04:32 - you've heard of abinav Gupta if you haven't then you better quickly get to that book because the source of all Tantra you've heard of the viyan Tantra which Shiva says to Parvati the viyan so\n04:45 - these are two books you must have kantra by machra vantra Otherwise your foundation is shaky so please get to that and start studying that as fast as possible because all these other tantas\n04:58 - will come later after after the great vidan which is the source from Shiva and Parvati the other tantras a lot of Buddhist tantas have been mixed into the tantas and the Tantra in India and\n05:13 - Buddhist tantas have been mixed up but the fear in the Buddhist tantas is only one they cannot pronounce the Sanskrit words properly so therefore for the mantras in\n05:28 - Tantra a tantra actually requires three things a yantra a mantra and a tantra these three make up the process so the yantra is your body the Mantra is the sound and\n05:41 - the Tantra is the the energy which connects the sound to your body the mantric sound of the tongue connected to the to the gantri\n05:53 - body form the Tantra so the Mantra and the yantra are necessary for the Tantra then there are tantas which can be done left path right path singularly with\n06:07 - Partners they now tell us that America has started a new system they call it the DI system Dy a d diard or diard how do you pronounce it di but that's I I would dismiss it as\n06:21 - hug and Bosch because America did not start any diard system because in the the first di system was started by shiv and Parvati themselves or Adam and Eve started it I don't know\n06:33 - where Adam and Eve which which county they belong to but they because the diet system is of the first dual system of coupling and working scientifically for spiritual growth is by Tantra machendra\n06:44 - it's one of the oldest methods it's it's not a thing of dad system here started day before yesterday it was started long back where two partners were used to evolve their\n06:56 - spiritual selves yes what do you think of sex tantric sex I what do you think of eating a meal I don't give it much importance\n07:11 - it's a way of life so why make much a do about it it's very normal it's very natural if two partners come together and they are agreed why should we like uh jump in the middle say hey we are\n07:23 - Crusaders of the world and we are the only ones who wear white clothes and we have come to save you no none of our business it's a Well formulated science and I think that the woman is a great\n07:36 - power and an energy in the life of man just today in the television I read it's nothing to do with so scientific or higher stage of Tantra but very normal very first stage they have found out\n07:48 - that people with married men who are married invariably live longer they've take taken statistics all over the world men with Partners live longer than single men\n08:00 - that means they get the support of the energy of the Shakti the man supports her with his confidence she supports with energy and they live a more glorious and graceful life it is more\n08:10 - graceful to live as Shiva and Shakti rather than live as Shiva alone or shaki alone it was not meant to be that way I think they were born to fuse he for God alone and she for God in\n08:28 - him and a man reminds a woman where she should go and takes her\n08:43 - there and a woman reminds man where he came from and the man reminds woman where they should go so he's born from her and he leads her to God\n09:00 - so it's a cycle so he reminds of the source she reminds him of the source of this birth on Earth he reminds her of their both their source as birth in heaven so\n09:13 - they're both right the birth of Consciousness and the birth of body so she represents the mayak aspect the three-dimensional aspect of Earth Mother Cadian rhythms he represents the\n09:25 - Shiva and the purush aspects of the ultimate finality she repres resents the phenomena of life and he represents the phenomena of spirit and so the cycle goes on therefore Tantra is very good if\n09:39 - done with the proper type of reverence for one another as God and godess next [Music]\n09:58 - question [Music] [Music] oh",

their blessing mode to bless you and to teach you to celebrate livingness now let's talk about celebrating livingness many people have often asked\n00:40 - me what it is like in states of meditation in states of sadii in states of superconscious sadii what are these states\n00:56 - like where do you go what do you set celebrate what are your spiritual experiences in this state of expanded\n01:10 - Consciousness so I'm going to explain to you now briefly it will be spoken in the Hindi and bojpuri language and translated into English called celebrating livingness\n01:24 - what are these this poetry is called the joys the of festivals in meditation and in samadi of course these are states of saal so the first ver in celebrating\n01:43 - livingness in Shambala what happens when the yogi I have made this poem joys of festivals in meditation called\n02:01 - so the first verse goes the [Music] celebration so the yogi says when I go into meditation this is my personal\n02:29 - experience I feel that I'm not of this world I belong to another land where there is no life or death in that land people are Immortal and when\n02:45 - we go into transend meditation we feel that there is a certain elixir of immortality about us within and without us and we have that inner knowingness that we can never die\n03:04 - life and death there is not so all the 12 months I'm drinking of the embro of and and of the nectar of the of the great City the white Island at Shambala called\n03:24 - shamur This is the celebration of the yogi in his superc conscious States of samadi the next experience I had which I put into poetic form\n03:53 - is he says I a traveler to this land I belong to the land of Shambala the Divine Island and in that Land There is it is ever spring it's always spring there is never\n04:07 - the cold and cruel Winters or the hot heated Summers to torture the person flowers are always there the garden is always blooming and this is the season of bassant the season of\n04:21 - spring and he says in that Perpetual spring the fresh season the seven lotuses of my chakras all open up and he says I say this all these opened Lotus chakras of Mind are dedicated at the\n04:39 - feet of gorat shiv goraka babaj this is the second verse of celebrating livingness how a yogi celebrates livingness in a\n04:53 - superconscious states of samadi superc conscious states of samadi third verse goes now this is about the festival holy the first one was the second verse was\n05:09 - basant panchami the second Festival is the Festival of holy in India the Festival of Colors [Music] [Music]\n05:35 - so he says in this Festival of Colors called holy many people spray the Divine colors of light and rainbows upon one another in this Holy Land of Shambala and as these colors are\n05:52 - sprayed the colors of love and compassion devotion dedication Integrity sacrifice all these other seven colors of the rainbow which have their Hues but when you go beyond this and you spin\n06:06 - fast with the seven colors you wh round and round in the viver the Krishna Vier the Shiva viver you spring round and round all the seven colors of the spectrum the colors which are sprayed\n06:19 - onto your body turn to the color white so now the fourth verse is of the Festival of Lights called Diwali we had basant panchi had Hool now we have Diwali he says in the Festival of Lights\n06:59 - I go all seven chakras of mine are spinning like seven wheels of fire multicolored and seven colors and so brilliant and full of light and love are those colors that even in the\n07:11 - daytime even in the daytime you can see the the inner lights of the spiritual self before which the daylight Fades into insignificance this is Diwali the\n07:22 - Festival of Colors and after the Festival of kalas comes the fifth joys of festivals in the superc conscious states of Samad which is called the\n07:31 - Sarah the Royal Festival the Festival of the Festival of Sound and Music Valor all these colors so this is the ra so he says in this Festival of Thea\n08:04 - you see India such an ancient and a rich culture that they are very very deeply rooted festivals celebrations I would call this is the way to celebrate Life The Common Man celebrates these\n08:18 - festivals outside externally objectively and the yogi celebrates these festivals subjectively and internally so the Festival of Desa J the Symphonies there are 36 Symphonies\n08:34 - six rags and six Ragin and these rags and rages are heard when I go into that state of samadi I go into the land of the of of the the hamsas the land of the Brave the land of\n08:49 - divinity the land of Purity called Shambala there is the white Island when the king comes he is honored with the 36 Symphonies of music and the drum Bongos the drums they make\n09:06 - a sound oh and so sweet is the sound that it puts you into a state of TR of course the yogi is already listening to this in a state of TR and samadi but he goes\n09:19 - further deeper to Revel in these joys of celestial music so this is the Festival of the sah now the sixth verse comes as the yogi in celebrating life and\n09:33 - livingness he giving his true identity who he is a very [Music] belongs so he says in this verse this is not his identity this is where he says\n10:02 - that so dedicated I am I to babaii to shiv goraka babaii so dedicated I am that I forget myself and I'm so surrendered to him that in this state of trans he is doing the Jer of\n10:19 - sh and I'm just observing myself and sound is coming from within me that somebody else is doing the job gorak is doing the job and I'm just the witness so he is so loving and\n10:31 - merciful so he says I go to the country and the land where Baba is the Supreme King shiv goraka Babaji the king of Shambala the king of sh deep the white Island and he says when I go there babai\n10:45 - is the one who's chanting for me because I'm so I've surrendered myself so much to him that it is he and not me who is doing the chant and then last of all he comes to the ver of giving his identity\n10:57 - in the superconscious states of ecstasy so in this state I experienced that had gone to deep far land in my innermost consciousness and I I gave them my identity that my\n11:36 - name is sidath the state or the boundless country where I live the town where I live is known as s is my\n11:53 - name and the name of my Village my town is Amat bam am it is the house of rest where you get total satisfaction and rest in the third eye\n12:10 - in third ventricle in the Braha of the third eye it is called called Amit Gat the source of nectar the name of the town is source of\n12:23 - nectar and a place for Eternal peace and rest my name is Sid I come from the town of Shambala the white Island in a place called in Shambala and the name of my\n12:42 - town is the the nectar of Eternal rest which is located deep behind the third eye in the third ventricle called the Brahma that's where reside so this is the joys of festivals in Dan\n13:03 -

          "transcript": "00:04 - right so you cushion yourself with God and not with ego you shift your identity from the perishable body and mind to the divine imperishable soul or divine soul or divine Shiva divine\n00:22 - Babaji divine Sadhguru you are the breeder of my breath breathe through me is that is that okay is that satisfactory that is the solution shift your identity shift your identity from\n00:40 - your not self to your true self can you understand I yes always shift your identity because I creeps in ever so slightly every time and you think that you are the doer yes is it you feel\n01:05 - this in your life path is it okay to want material things like Fame and success then or is it better to ascend beyond that because those are associated with the ego and transcend beyond that\n01:20 - and find more gratification so why are you doubting it is you who have to make up your mind I cannot say it is you see it's good to have money it's good to have name it's good to have Fame it's\n01:35 - good to have went you know it's good to be liked by many people is good to become famous it's good to you know wield influence and win a lot of friends it's good to earn more money and it's\n01:50 - good to transcend these things is good to go to serenity and tranquility and see the divine life within you it's good to go to moksha is good to be one with God it's good to be blessed by God\n02:01 - everything is good nothing is bad and my counter question to you is what do you want I'm not going to fall into this trap and force you say worship Allah and you have to go to the the mosque or the\n02:19 - temple every Thursday you have to be you know say om namashivaya you have to do Kriya yoga I'm not falling in that trap what do you want you don't want to do creative Dondo\n02:34 - Kriya yoga don't put me in the box you don't want to do those three I have don't do creo I'm not going to hate you for it as still love you you want to do create your cream you don't want God\n02:50 - don't want God so this is a choice which you should make but what I am teaching what I am propagating is that these things of money name and fame are even instant they vanish like a perfume\n03:08 - sprayed in the air they don't last the everlasting perfume is the perfume of the soul this not only gives you the flavor but gives you the immortality so what I'm saying is don't invest your\n03:22 - time and energy in perishable even incent things which have gone with the wind like chasing Jason's fleece the will of the wisp invest in something which is\n03:35 - permanent which is everlasting and that is nothing to do with the senses or name fame and ego it's got to do beyond mine beyond ego beyond name and beyond Fame because where you are not and only God\n03:46 - is that is the place to be so write teach so you choose what you like I hope I'm not being too pushy with yours right got it so I am teaching I will always say these things are useless now also\n04:17 - all these things which we are doing clicker the beautiful things how its arranged today it is to encourage people we are in a world of relativity some form of earning some for the form of\n04:30 - finance needs a society needs to have to sustain itself but it should just sustain itself but this is for you this is a spiritual garden which is being created\n04:43 - people all over the world and people come here all over the world to distinguish between the truth and the falsehood the real and the even isn't divinity\n05:10 - you see it's not for us it is no use talking about healing or giving you techniques and all because I can't wait for you to practice your techniques and then get there and all the the fact of\n05:23 - the matter that I have to get and work in the Dream Weaver and quickly change the genome the DNA and get you on the fast track the Lightning path because if you don't get your me Lightning path\n05:37 - then evolution will be slow and sluggish but still you will be made the effort and I encourage you to make the effort because I don't want to take away your self-esteem because your self-esteem is\n05:53 - not your pride it is an inner thankfulness for God to God for allowing you to labor and to work and to climb the mountain towards him so that through the sweat of your brow and your own\n06:09 - effort you get the hard-won gold of God's love right but with all due respect I don't think that the other religions offer it so specifically and scientifically as\n06:28 - the Sanatan Dharma and the yogic techniques they're in because if we have in Christianity it's a one-man show one man called Adam comes he creates the first sin which is God did not face us\n06:49 - in neither did he save survive features he just related to the woman always why did God make woman so I say it's the first virtue and they had came enable maybe one was virtuous one will not\n07:05 - that's a different issue but procreation stops so that is the first Manu Manu swayambhu and Shatter oopah Manu is the first swam Bumi is born of the self that is Adam Adam Adam comes from the word\n07:21 - Adam means ah dum means breath incoming breath so the first breath of life was Adam and Eva miss a feminine path dynamic path which is chaparral washi\n07:40 - with a thousand forms that's how creation started and ended when he came he started this creation God said don't start it in all this TARDIS recreated the percent according to me the\n07:59 - Christian theology and then things went on fine and all that people are doing or not doing anything and we had legends and stories and dramas and they had his sock and shoe coupe and Ishmael and\n08:17 - Jacob and Isaac is actually they don't pronounce the Isaac is he suck in Hebrew and Jacob is Yahoo so this is all Hebrew words she later taken by Islam this and and a Brahma Abram means the father of\n08:36 - the creator to this thing and Samson and Delilah and so life went on for many many years till humanity edit create accumulated enough karma then the great Christ came down he prepared the man\n08:53 - Jesus to enter his body for forty days and forty nights didn't she is astray and then all the sin the original sin created by Adam and the people died after Christ was\n09:07 - crucified and he delivered them from the SID but I am saying what role does all of us have to play in this the humanity at large the thousands of souls you don't\n09:18 - do anything one man creates the sin you will join in the sin then the other man comes with other Christ and he liberates you from that sin its salvation so what do you do\n09:29 - where is your self-esteem have you won your hard-won gold to a heaven have you done any practice in a spiritual effort to get to your Lord and tell him Lord by the sweat of\n09:41 - my brow I toiled night and day I loved night and day I lived night and day for you O Lord I saw God I heard God a smelt God I tasted God I lived God had died God God God God God\n09:58 - God God he should go to God saying that but there's no scope on auspicious specific technique given in India in the mainstream of the Islamic or the Christian religion whereby you could use\n10:14 - a tool on your own to bring ease in order in your daily life and also reach the God within and the universal God such a technique is called yoga we have specialized that into kondal any Kriya\n10:28 - yoga is that right I so there you have the self-esteem your own effort even though the Guru helps she makes you struggle along the path unless you have a specific scientific technique to\n10:48 - approach God which is which is embellished and ingrained with devotion life is not worth living or that's why it's so boring life the same old faces same old people the same old money the\n11:06 - same old joy the same old sorrow but God is shocking anew from moment to moment let's get into that eternal bliss which is ever new and wondrous and the birthright of all souls was come upon\n11:26 -

          "title": "Was MOSES wrong? -You must must MUST IDOL WORSHIP!? - Part 1",
          "transcript": "00:03 - [Music] [Music] sh sh [Music]\n00:39 - so do you think the statement which is being put in the seek religion by gur nanak saying people say byak that idol worship is a same did he mean something else he didn't say Moses Moses said it\n00:49 - long time back so what did they actually mean what did they actually mean when they say idol worship is the same because that's the thing which is separating that too new a religion for\n00:58 - me to comment on but but uh the first direct glaring example is it's taken directly from the mouth of Moses who said th God's words to Moses said Thou shalt have no other God before me Thou\n01:12 - shalt not worship idols but I don't think anyone has explained it like gurunath has explained it I'm not saying it as a bombast or something gurunath says that this is a\n01:23 - psychological thing do not focus your identity on your physical body body or your mind shift your identity change the\n01:34 - gal and think that you are Consciousness and not this house of Flesh and Bone which sleeps decays and dies I am Immortal Consciousness lord of the earth and life this is what he could have\n01:45 - meant by do not worship idols it was more esoteric than brother much more esoteric gurunath has given much more esoteric teachings than the grar see it compare it it's tape to tape\n01:58 - you can compare it not that I'm small smaller or greater or this or that is just things as they are because you have evolved and you have demanded from me you have drawn out from me a deeperc\n02:09 - meaning for everything by just sitting here because just like people get the government they deserve people get the guru they deserve and so also people get the\n02:20 - philosophic teachings they deserve if the people are deep then the teaching shall be deep if your demand is deep then I will go deep and this is what it means neither the Bible nor the Jews nor\n02:32 - the siks have explained that idol worship it does not mean uh that Breaking All the idols and breaking this teapot and everything is an idol the bulb is an idol the fan is an idol this\n02:44 - is a picture so it doesn't mean that it means you should not identify with your physical body or with any statues of gods and goddesses but you should identify with your Consciousness that's\n02:58 - what they meant but with all due respects to the great one of the greatest avars whom I personally believe to be is Moses greater than gurun nanak and maybe the\n03:10 - guru of gurun nanak and maybe a junior contemporary of Baba himself I associate him very closely with SRI yukteswar I don't know how that formula works out but I with with uh all\n03:23 - due respects to Moses I would not venture to go up to Yahweh who is gorak himself I would not go up that they should have explained this more clearly maybe I'm someone from that time someone\n03:39 - who's explaining it to you now they should have explained this to the people secondly they should have also said that this commandment which I'm giving you is for the very Advanced practitioners\n03:52 - which you will which you are some of you are and some of you will be in a year 2 years 3 years 4 years because of the fourth toker Kaa because I personally my\n04:03 - opinion is different to gurun nanak's and Moses's opinion which is a bold statement I would not say although it's come from gorak himself of from from Yahweh\n04:18 - yah yah yah that's the name of Yahweh he says Thou shalt not worship idols it is not possible any for anyone not to worship idols at the initial stages you have to have an idol\n04:35 - otherwise how will you bind your mind to the object of your love once your mind is bound to your mahaguru it penetrates the atoms and then you merge and feel you are you are a part and parcel of\n04:51 - Shiva you become associated you are integrated with Shiva if you keep medra you you go into the subatomic sphere different dimension you penetrate the atoms of being Shiva and go into the\n05:04 - subatomic particles of Shiva if you keep looking at it then the form the idol of Shiva will will disappear so the idol worship will disappear automatically and then there will be what worship\n05:16 - attribute worship then you will there will be no form there will be just a bliss he will be you and you will be you'll become one with him Sam and when you become one with him there'll be no\n05:26 - idol worship there'll be no form and then you will feel you will feel feel that you are floating in a ocean of bliss then you will be worshiping not Shiva but the attribute of Shiva called\n05:42 - sachidanand and then when you go still deeper the attribute will disappear and you will just be observing that and being the\n05:55 - whole of the mind and matter of the universe so first you will be an integral part of the day to you worship the idol you worship then you'll be the idol you worship by being its\n06:08 - attributes then you will be beyond the attributes and become pure Consciousness you are Immortal Consciousness lord of the earth and skies so this do not do idol worship and do what that is not\n06:23 - said in the 10 commandments you're telling us not to do idol worship but to do what I am here telling you that for first begin with idol worship train your mind to focus on the figure of your\n06:34 - beloved once your mind is focused go deeper the form disappears many of you when I give the shaath the form disappears have you seen that the idol disappears so that's what it means do\n06:47 - not idol worship but that is an advanced stage you cannot get to the stage of no idol worship before first worshiping the idols and don't tell me all these terrorists and the whole of Islam and\n06:58 - the whole of Christianity you know KS cheese and cakes on Sunday with Canary hats socializing can go straight into the state of Shiva paath the no mind state of cosmic awareness\n07:09 - can they so so I think oh Lord thou Hast jumped the fence and you haven't given to kindergarten the things of kindergarten first so You' given the poer to us yeah that's something like\n07:24 - this but at a lower level because you're still pinning the you're still pinning on every Lotus and the word you have the word in the form that's an example where given ahead\n07:35 - of time so that but they give no techniques so do not idol worship means okay God we don't idol worship then what do we do we sit idle we have to idol worship to get to a\n07:49 - state of non-idol worship to get to a state of non-idol worship you have to do idol worship to get to a state of non-doing you have to do something this is the psychology of the human mind\n08:03 - this is the psychology of the human mind that it has to be bound to a particular person place or thing it has to be concentrated and when your concentration reaches what is called vanishing point\n08:18 - you concentrate on the point when your concentration reaches vanishing point the idol before you disappears Thou shalt not idol worship oh Lord I have foed filled your desire\n08:32 - and your commandment by intensely focusing on the idol so that that I made it disappear so that I have entered into a subtler strata from the atomic strata\n08:43 - I've entered the subatomic strata where oh Lord now I am not worshiping Idols your neither yours nor anyone's I'm worshiping the attributes of the truth that you are and as I go into the\n08:55 - attributes and all I still have the eye in me I still have the pro on and that at this stage where I'm floating in a sea of bliss I lose myself I lose my ego and I am\n09:09 - everywhere in Bliss I lose my ego at the subatomic State when I enter the electron so I've got rid of the desires which is the neutron I've got uh rid of\n09:24 - the activity of mind which is which is the ego which is Pro on and now I can take the final leap of divine Consciousness and I rid myself of the ultimate of ultimate building block of\n09:39 - creation which is called the electron once I split the electron I go into he about whom not may be said which people\n09:56 - variously call A Prat samadi the nirvikalp samadi but then too I'm pulled back again and again with of past desires which Bubble Up from the surface of my mind's Lake\n10:12 - and pull the flying swan down again into the weeds of Desire illusion delusion and error",

          "title": "December 2017 full moon message - Yogiraj on Raja yoga and Ashtanga yoga",
          "transcript": "00:03 - hi guys my dear Souls at the level of breath heartbeat and consciousness we are all one today I'm gonna speak to you of my personal practice of the astanga-yoga the raja yoke and out how\n00:27 - its techniques help to refine and to develop and to focus one's mind so of course in the raja yoga system you know we have yum which is and yum which is restraint then we have Nia which is do's\n00:54 - don'ts induce after that we have youngnam asan's bodily postures to make the body strong and flexible to facilitate the growth of the electromagnetic energy called Kundalini\n01:11 - then we have pranayama the life force energy control which further enhances the rising of the electromagnetic power called the Kundalini after pronoun they have the technique of Roger called\n01:28 - Preity Harr the withdrawal of the senses and the electricity in the senses from the contact of their external objects that is the five senses of sight taste touch smell and sound when they are\n01:46 - introverted by a magnetic process of prana arm then the mind can be photo tea focused after this process we have the Hana which is concentration binding the mind to a single object then we have the\n02:02 - on where the mind flows effortlessly focused on the object of its attention and then we have Samadhi the ecstasy of expanded awareness so you know the do's and don'ts everybody must\n02:20 - have to discipline themselves at a certain level you know getting up at the same time sitting for meditation at the same time so you get up at 6:00 in the morning you sit at 6 we sit at 6 in the\n02:32 - evening whatever chosen time so that is that is the dues the NIAMS don'ts are not to indulge in too much heavy eating not to have too much of a rajasic food or\n02:46 - thamma 16 food but to have fresh fruit so do's and don'ts these are called iminium and after that you get to the bodily postures which are not yoga in itself but all these techniques of yum\n03:02 - niyam hacen pranaam are assisting in the process of yoga so after your body is made fit and you feel in a good and healthy condition your spine feels\n03:15 - flexible then you sit down in this the ultimate arson is the steady posture the citizen of the Lotus posture Padma since then you start with the process of pranayama you see why I'm telling you\n03:29 - this because it's all like a complete wheel if you break any portion of the wheel the wheel the cycle will not run so the cycle of your evolution will not happen if any one of these wheels have a\n03:41 - disturbance or are broken it will run but haphazardly less efficiently so I'm starting with Brannon pranam now I'll tell you when you breathe the life force energy steadily\n03:58 - it creates an electromagnetic flow in your spinal cord a concentrated system of breathing a concentrated system of pranayama which is lifeforce energy control leads to\n04:17 - magnetization of the spine so concentrated pranayam creates and leads to a good breath the heart that is withdrawal of the electromagnetic energy in the senses the withdrawal of the\n04:35 - senses from their object is best achieved by a smooth and regular prana you can't have a haphazard pronoun and expect to have a good prepare or if you don't master your withdrawal of sensors\n04:47 - from the objects the sensors will of obviously being distracting and you will not be able to do concentration so with a smooth perfect concentrated pranayama life force energy control results in a\n05:00 - good breath they are the results in the good introversion of your five senses now if your $0.05 telephones of sight taste smell sight and sound etc are outward going extroverted your mind will\n05:15 - get distracted and not able to concentrate therefore in order to concentrate your mind to get to the next level first is prana done with concentration leads to a good\n05:28 - prat they are a good prop they are is introversion of the senses makes you free from the distraction of outer objects of sight taste smell touch and sound now once these sense telephones\n05:43 - are cut by introvert in the sense telephones there is nothing external to extract to distract your mind and when there is nothing external to distract your mind\n05:54 - your mind becomes totally automatically focused so from prana you've smoothly flow into Proteus introversion and withdrawal of the sensors from the objects and with\n06:07 - that repetitive practice of the withdrawal of the senses of protein you lead to the Hana which is concentration because the mind is free from external distraction of the senses and can rest\n06:19 - in a focused awareness it can rest steady on an object but in spite of that the mind has deeper layers which are called subliminal expressions impressions of\n06:35 - sound scars which tend to waver the mind now in order to do that you have to repeatedly bring your mind to the focus of your attention suppose you are focusing on a candle\n06:45 - flame and your mind goes running errands oh I have to make my bed oh my son's coming at day after tomorrow I have to see that his room is cleaned all these thoughts will come no you have\n06:57 - to pull repeatedly pull your thoughts back to the focus of your attention that is the flame say me and the flame are one I am concentrating on the flame so that is the are now concentration when\n07:09 - you perfect this and there are no distractions in your focused mind when you are able to bind your mind to a single object that is known the repeated bringing back to binding your mind the\n07:24 - repeated practice of of of bringing back the wayward mind to the flame is called the practice of concentration when concentration is achieved the Faculty of exclusive attention it automatically\n07:42 - flows into Han which is meditation so the practice of bringing the earing mind back to the flame is called concentration the practice when you are perfectly concentrated without any\n08:01 - distraction and the mind is steadily gazing on the flame it is called meditation or yarn but then the last stage comes when you are so focused and steady on the flame that you and the\n08:15 - flame the identity is not separate you and the flame become one by that I don't mean that you get burnt by the flame or something I mean that you and the flame become one focus one flow of\n08:29 - concentration effortless concentration is meditation is meditation and when the meditation is further goes so deep into a deeper layer of subatomic particles from the atomic meditation it\n08:43 - goes to the attributes that you and the flame feel as one there is no separation there is no partition that is known as Samadhi but that is still objectified Samadhi which is known as savikalpa\n08:56 - samadhi where the subject and the object become one it is called some young Samadhi sabha called Samadhi where Darla Darla and Samadhi are in one flow where concentration meditation and ecstasy\n09:12 - become one then you and the flame become one by this technique of focused awareness you get into a state of Samadhi which is Sabha called Samadhi so these techniques refine your mind\n09:26 - further and further and further and within the deepest layer of your mind is the Atma the conscious here and as your mind becomes more and more refined and focused the effulgence of the conscious\n09:39 - seer the effulgence of the earth machines forth and you know people tell you often oh look at you how you're glowing look at your aura around you people themselves are meditating they\n09:48 - themselves by vegetarian diet and sattvic diet are becoming more sensitive so they can see the yogi advancing and developing and transforming matter his body matter into energy matter energy\n10:01 - matter into light stuff and light you and the flame become one it's a state of the first state of Samadhi but it is still through the divine mind the mind is there the ultimate state of Samadhi\n10:17 - is to rip off the veil of the mind to take away the veil of the mind and you stand in naked truth that is your transition from divine mind to divine consciousness where there is no mind\n10:32 - it's just isolated awareness that is miracle or new seedless Samadhi which we say Assam Pradesh Samadhi or near beach Samadhi so these are the techniques of Varna GaN\n10:48 - and Samadhi which make you more and more refined and the more refined your mind gets the closer you get to self-realization that I'm not the corruptible body I am the divine soul\n11:03 - and with this dear Souls my blessings to you I end this satsang may you prosper on the spiritual path may you find peace I pray for your peace I pray for your prosperity and I pray that in this life\n11:19 - you make the endeavor to seek the truth within the answer lies within the answer lies within oh no Monsieur",

          "title": "Are people inherently hypocritical or noble? - Siddhanath",
          "transcript": "00:00 - you make a sincere effort to love a person bandage his wounds heal his wounds even though you feel if it a little and not emotionally and partially that generates the larger love of\n00:12 - humanity and we are making an effort to generate this love even if it first starts with an imitation it starts with a concert of life if you keep doing it by constant practice that love is\n00:25 - generated in you such is the sole nature of mankind I tell you from my my experience such as the sole nature of humankind that if he stretches a hand to a fallen brother in his stretching that\n00:39 - emotion and the Hand going out tears come in his eyes because that posture is such he doesn't mean to cry but he said I couldn't help it when I picked you over I felt a certain Oneness with you\n00:52 - and man never knows what's coming out for him because he's so deep in his Consciousness he's so rich and So Glorious that is the truth and the Consciousness we are trying to evolve\n01:03 - out of you to get out of you and that's what really happens when you make the effort even if it's a concert even if it's an enacted effort if it is Noble in its act I've seen people who enact\n01:15 - certain things and then they become what they act they become what they like this is so beautiful yes it really happens but the inner resources of the Soul are pulled out so you don't stagnate and say\n01:28 - I'm not like this because I'm going to be like this this I don't love you man no no that's not the way go forth stretch your hand even a hypocrite can become genuine because hypocrisy is a\n01:39 - temporary thing the soul is pure and love so the the the the acting of it would help the dramatization would help to throw aside the Garment of hypocrisy and negativity and falsehood and bring\n01:54 - forth The Shining Soul this is the effort we are making in true practice of sadna and in our dress rehearsal let us dress rehearse to be Saints let us dress rehearse to be gods and angels and so\n02:08 - shall we be to the likeness of your thinking shall your character be made yes so dig deep your Consciousness with intellectual Spade with absorption Spade with meditation\n02:23 - spade and so you will get this out and I feel it's very very important we have to love to flow in work whether we like it or not people pin themselves on to the guru and they say okay the guru has said\n02:36 - be good to everyone serve them with no reward selflessly treat Humanity as one's larger self I'm going to do it and while doing it they'll say Guru I just did it for the fun of it and while doing\n02:46 - it I'm transformed what the hell has happened to me why do I cry for every human soul why does my heart reach out what's happening to me what is this Alchemy I didn't know that I was so deep\n02:56 - I didn't know I was a saint I used to go murdering people and so I said I can't take damn God I I can't take God's name I'm not going to I'll take death's name death death death\n03:12 - death death Death so they said okay take death's name so the saint started with saying death death in Hindi is called Mara Mara die die die so he said mar mar what the hell has happened to me Guru\n03:37 - what the hell you gave me poison Mantra and it turned to a nectar Mantra is this what happened so if we are truthful and we don't love humanity and we hate human beings and we are murderers that doesn't\n03:50 - mean that we shouldn't try to be good we shouldn't try to concert it we shouldn't try to dress re it's so beautiful play Shiva wow the Crescent here and the Galaxy is\n04:02 - Flowing out of your head what a thought and the whole universe held like a little marble in the palm of your hand and you fling it into the air and a countless universes are created what a\n04:16 - thought so why not be Noble and glorious why not live the the richness of a positive and powerful and glorious thought instead of opening the can of worms the subconscious ious mind leave\n04:31 - it alone don't try to sweep the darkness out of the room which shall not go climb up the spiral staircase of your Consciousness there in the corner go and put on the lights and the Darkness of\n04:45 - the subconscious mind shall be not this is how we do it it's not the only way one of the ways yes we have a a saying in America bake it till you make it bake it till you make it bake it fake\n04:60 - it fake it till you fake it yes yes fake it till you make it because there's no such thing as fake when you fake it each time you fake it every fake touches deeper and deeper into your\n05:11 - Consciousness into your heart and you say what if what if I'm truly a saint but they do not know that that faking is just called sadna it is the practice of spiritual growth you can't hit the\n05:24 - bullseye every time you got to keep trying practice makes perfect so what you call fake we call the practice of spiritual growth it is a truthful Endeavor to get to what you are\n05:37 - not okay a truthful Endeavor I know you're not Shiva I know you're not Buddha but a truthful Endeavor to imagine that you're sha your yukteswar your baba and do the\n05:50 - Shiva nobody is perfect so the word fake is the practice of spiritual growth and this is very very important important and you will see that by\n06:03 - faking it suddenly your body will dissolve they'll see an aura around you so the fake has become a truth so what isn't this Leela of God this Maya all about the fake becoming\n06:16 - the truth the illusion becoming truth trans transcending the illusion rather than trying to be the devil why not try to be the angel why not try to be Lucifer the lightbringer\n06:29 - so what you think is not faking repetitive thinking of light and truth and strength creates a resonant frequency which transforms every molecule and atom of your brain cells\n06:39 - and mind into light and Truth and Love so to the likeness of your thinking shall the quality of your being be made it's very important enough yeah best compliment\n06:56 - you can give an experience jazz musician is to call him a good thing cuz that's what they're doing they're putting themselves in a situation before they know what they're going to do but\n07:06 - they trust that they're going to be able to I don't know know where the origins of the root fake are I don't not know what the origins are Latin or Sanskrit or whatever but the word fi means uh I\n07:21 - would take the word fake fake now to throw to throw yourself heart and soul into what you want to be and when you fake means fake means throw so when you fake when you throw yourself\n07:37 - heart and soul into what you want to be that you become that's what fake means it was throw it it was earlier this year we were talking about this and I mentioned to you a phrase that some\n07:49 - Buddhists use which is is in practicing they say pretend pretend pretend become become become and you immediately said you turn it around wonderfully and you said become become be\n08:05 - yes becoming becoming be because that's what we doing becoming becoming be I do not know what happens to the crystas and the Kon and then ultimately it weaves its karma around itself and is\n08:21 - stuck and then ultimately it dissolves and turns into the butterfly and flies out if a cocoon can turn into the butterfly all of you have of hope you who abound in this body of Flesh and\n08:32 - Bones in the five senses the soul hamsa can fly out one day it shall and it will for I have experienced the HSA flying out of my body leaving the carcass of Flesh lying down if one can do it all\n08:45 - can do it why constantly think that you've got AIDS and cancer when you can think that you're light and you're the Archangel Gabriel you're the Michael the angel of\n08:56 - the face of God you're glorious you're radiant you're the light of Love imagine yourself as a powerful solar being radiating love and peace to all who come in your path irrespective of whether\n09:09 - they hate you or whether they love you still keep on loving them do not react be a powerful Dynamo of spirituality the radiating love and truth to the world from moment to moment till you die out\n09:21 - unto them and Blaze away or create a supernova explosion explode your love into them and be not that is the purpose of\n09:32 - life that is so glorious and people who thinking that even the Buddha said that what you think you shall become so if your thinking is Faking It which it\n09:44 - is acting that fake acting the thought is more than thought and then after you act it you become it that's a process you must act on what you think and be what you act that's the that's\n09:59 - that's the thing it comes from a desire the desire is translated into an action and when an action thing many of people will wi the Purple Heart die at the expense give up their lives become what\n10:12 - their dreams of What Dreams May Come of What Dreams May Come definitely positive powerful and therefore we serve with a strong heart we Blast away like one lady told me all the negativity was there\n10:26 - when you made that sound all that negative stuff was blast Ed away and I'm so light I don't know I was just spread eagled all over the place and when I came back I was\n10:38 - crystal I said are you hurt or can I align you she said no you totally disigned my thoughts which were Prejudiced and limited and now I'm free and flowing\n10:49 - that's what it's all about the healing to be healing to be the ultimate healing is God realization self-actualization that's what we're doing",

          "title": "If The Soul Is Enlightened, Why Do Yoga?",
          "transcript": "00:14 - ah once a person came up to me and he asked me he said guru not in the Buddhist philosophy and literature they say that the soul is enlightened and he went on\n00:45 - to ask that if the soul is enlightened then why do you advocate the practice of yoga or Kriya yoga so to this I answered I said look not only Buddhism but every religion says that the soul is\n01:09 - enlightened even in the bhagavad-gita it says that soul is enlightened and since Buddha was not a Buddhist at the time he had nothing else to read but the bhagavad-gita and the Rama and which his\n01:24 - mother told him stories about and in the bhagavad-gita it all also says nanyem Chanda tshis Rani naanum deity pavakah macclare the ante upon associate &#39;martha so it says that the soul is immortal\n01:42 - it it cannot be cut by the weapons it cannot be burnt by fire it cannot be dried by Drew Brees it cannot be wet by water it is the immortal infinite soul and yet in the Gita itself certain\n01:60 - spiritual practices are mentioned now the answer to the question is this that the soul is immortal the soul is enlightened but the question is this that the mud of your mind which\n02:19 - covers the soul is not enlightened so I say unto you each soul is potentially divine in order to bring out the divinity of your soul to express the divinity of your soul you must wash\n02:38 - the mud of the mind that covers the splendor of your soul by the practice of Kriya yoga that is why you must practice yoga the practice of yoga is like cleaning the lam glass you must first\n02:53 - learn to identify yourself and ask yourself the question which I asked you now are you the corruptible body or the divine soul if you are the corruptible body you are not enlightened and can\n03:07 - never be if you are the divine soul you are potentially enlightened and you are covered by the ignorance of the mind a normal human being lives in a bedlam of misery created by their own thoughts\n03:27 - more often than not and to create and to prevent these thoughts to clear these thoughts a certain physical emotional and mental discipline is required and the mental emotional and physical\n03:47 - discipline required to move the disturbances of the mind and the emotions are called the various assisting practices of yoga although yoga itself is nothing short of\n04:07 - the complete merger of the individual consciousness with the universal consciousness which we in yogic Palance called the merger of Jeeva the soul with Shiva the universal spirit\n04:22 - so in order to wash away the mud of the mind and its irrelevant thoughts which cover the splendor of the soul we do the ceaseless and persistent practice of Kriya yoga which soothes the nerves and\n04:42 - stills the mind we can liken the mind to a ruffled lake and the ripples of thoughts in the minds lake prevent us from seeing this the moon of our delight which is the sole\n05:02 - Kriya yoga calms these ripples of thought it stills the ripples of thoughts in the minds lake and then and then alone are you able to see the moon of your delight in the still skies by\n05:21 - the moon of your delight I mean your divine soul only when by the practice of yoga and by the practice of Kriya yoga you are able to still your mind can the whole of nature and the whole of truth\n05:41 - be reflected in this crystal mind in all its splendor in all its joy and in all its glory and therefore it is very necessary in spite of every soul being enlightened in order to remove the\n06:02 - ignorance of the mind the obstacle of mind the cloud of mind which covers the splendor of your soul it is very necessary to practice the science of Kundalini Kriya yoga or Raja yoga or\n06:23 - Gyana yoga or bhakti yoga that all these various yokes go towards uniting the individual soul with the universal spirit now as you keep practicing as you keep practicing let us say the Raj yogic\n06:48 - system you keep clearing your mind of three basic modes three basic attributes the first is Brittany which is called thought forms these thought forms are little\n07:14 - whirlpools which create ripples in the minds lake these random thought forms are stilled and lengthened and processed by the elongated breath the rhythm ik breath of Kriya yoga the brittnee&#39;s then\n07:34 - as you practice deeper from a state of meditation these ritas become still and you go into a state of a deeper meditation and then to savikalpa samadhi where you get rid\n07:53 - of all thought forms which are called practice but they means thought forms of visual images which are embedded deeper than random with these or thoughts so when you gradually dissolve these\n08:13 - thought forms you are in a higher state of meditation and getting into the state of an ecstasy of expanded consciousness which is the next higher state when you accomplish the state of savikalpa\n08:33 - samadhi or the state of expanded consciousness the ecstasy of expanded consciousness then you are said to have dissolved the practi eye is dissolved by a process called protein erode means the\n08:50 - restriction of thoughts by regular practice and willpower the restriction of thought forms by regular practice and control and as you go into the nirvikalpa samadhi state you go deeper\n09:09 - into the layers of your mind where you you remembered experiences coming from your past lives now you see the human mind is not so simple it&#39;s more complex than we\n09:20 - would think at the very surface and the periphery of the mind we have what is called thoughts which are British whirlpools of thoughts then as you go deeper from meditation to sub occult\n09:34 - Samadhi an ecstasy of expanded consciousness you you have to tackle and come face to face with deeper thought forms which are called throught the ayahs and the Yoga Sutras upon that\n09:47 - Patanjali they call it prop death and then as you go deeper and deeper in your career meditation where the breath is stopped and only the life energy moves in your spinal cord you come face to\n09:59 - face you know surfacing bubbling up from the surface of your mind&#39;s lake come remembered experiences not only of this but of past lives as well and they are called sound scars so remembered\n10:14 - experiences or thoughts of a past life thought forms of a past life are called sound scars and these sound scars are so deeply embedded in the mind stuff that they cannot be taken out unless you get\n10:37 - practice long years of nirvikalpa samadhi you have to keep practicing the highest state of Samadhi which is Samadhi without form without thought and then when the mind is totally cleared of\n10:56 - all these Britta thoughts Preity I thought forms and some scars are remembered experiences of thought forms when all the three layers of the mind are totally clear and there is not a\n11:15 - single desire or thought in your mind&#39;s lake the mind is like a crystal Placid pool then and then alone you can behold your Atma your divine soul as it is so you\n11:36 - are the divine soul the mind and its thoughts and thought forms a mere accessories that you have created due to past Karma&#39;s the mind associates its itself with the emotions and the\n11:52 - emotions associate themselves with the breath breath associates itself with the body and senses so also the Atma associates itself with a higher mind called body or intuition and because of\n12:08 - the association of the divine soul or Atma with your higher mind or body all these Karma&#39;s are created you are learning the lesson of life you&#39;re going through worlds experiences of right and\n12:25 - wrong and reacting to them accordingly as per your free will and this is what creates many many traumas or many many joys in the subconscious mind and therefore your subconscious mind your\n12:43 - conscious mind and your super conscious mind when they are all cleared of these various thoughts then and then alone you can realize that you are the immortal soul the divine soul and not the\n12:56 - corruptible body and you will be established in this realization but before the state of nirvikalpa samadhi or near beach samadhi you will realize god and you will realize that you are\n13:08 - the divine soul connected with God but you will forget when you go into your normal state then again when you go into a state of in expand its ecstasy of some other you will realize then again you\n13:19 - will be pulled down by thoughts in your mind&#39;s lake so the Swan really cannot fly to realize its own identity as the divine soul until each and every thought that is with the thought form which is\n13:36 - practice and Sons car which is remembered experiences of past lives are cleared from your minds lake although the sole Swan although you are\n13:45 - the sole the divine soul the soul Swan and you are enlightened you cannot realize your full potential as a realized being unless the disturbance of deceiving thoughts are cleared from your\n13:59 - mind and that is why when they say in various religions that you are enlightened you are only asking a question which is the half truth because you are enlightened but you should also\n14:14 - understand that the full truth is that your enlightenment is covered you forget that your enlightenment because your mind is very disturbed your body and emotions are very disturbed and unless\n14:27 - these factors of body mind and the higher mind the body emotions and mind are cleared of all their thoughts you cannot realize yourself as enlightened on and on but am I so Cod on KY long no\n14:53 - I&#39;m holding one watt peetam Goggin and saturation that was hard election",

          "transcript": "00:00 - oh the only purpose of man sergeant on this earth is to seek God so he's written this poem I scribbled it in a meditation when I was doing Kriya and the title I gave there's another\n00:22 - title of a more extensive thing was a small thing it can be put up it's called yoga yoga and yoga na yogi Yogi and yog anta what is the yogi say I practiced death I practiced death with bated\n00:40 - breath bated means measured and gradually decreasing breath I practiced death with bated breath became breathless to death by death when I practiced breath with bated breath when\n00:58 - I practiced death with bated breath I became deathless I became breathless to death I became breathless to death by death okay I became breathless to death and that's\n01:16 - what death wants because if you're breathing your life there's no life in breathlessness right so I became breathless to death by death there's a smaller death I became Restless\n01:27 - breathless to take in the support of the bigger death which was created I practice Kriya yoga I practice death with bated breath I practice Kriya yoga with bated breath\n01:38 - I practice death with bated breath became reckless to death by death and deathless have become and deathless have become but deathlessness to me is not you see he this is very because if you\n02:00 - become deathless and deathless have become I practice death with bated breath became breathless to death by death and deathless have become I died so many times\n02:14 - that I have become deathless so here's where America takes its attaboy because you become immortal you've achieved the goal right you've achieved the goal Leonid or did that people in America\n02:28 - practicing immortality but in that day this thing they preserve the eyelashes they preserve the eyebrows they preserve their breasts if they do if their breast gets cut or cut off then heaven is gone\n02:38 - so they're very body conscious and they think that body immortality is the final thing which it's a great thing Babaji himself and body immortality but here comes in the indian mind it gives\n02:52 - the zing of the sting this is the thought the indian thought comes in because this itself is a great thing to be debtless and deathless I became do you understand\n03:05 - when you become deathless you become what what is another word for that list ah a mortal and immortal I became when I am mortally with the gods it's finished the goal we have the Gurunath mind steps\n03:21 - in I practice death with bated breath became breathless to death by death and deathless have become finale Oh grave where is thy sting or death where is thy victory\n03:34 - you have conquered death right so this according to Leonardo and why not in the West and amongst the Greeks it is the finale that's where the Indian philosophers teach the Greek\n03:48 - philosophers when they went there they taught them and here comes the Guru not mind he's a party pooper I practice death with bated breath became breathless to death by death and\n04:02 - deathless have become I have become immortal but deathless myth but deathlessness to me is not the party pooper what does he say guru not but deathlessness\n04:18 - immortality me to his trash what's he talking about but deathlessness to me is not unless divinity is light shines forth but deathlessness to me is not immortality\n04:35 - to me is not unless divinity is light shines forth because if there's no divinity if there's immortality without divinity immortality is useless it is still duality it is still you've oh it's\n04:48 - still ego and that's where the Indian philosopher told the Greek philosopher that there's something in the beyond beyond immortality and that's what India is constantly reminding the West it's\n04:57 - not only about mr. Leonardo it's not only about immortality it's about divinity as well and immortality is useless unless you realize your own divinity but deathlessness to me is not\n05:10 - unless divinity is light shines forth melting even melting even the the immortal veil melting even the immortal veil Maya's last effort to derail melting\n05:30 - even the immortal way even immortality is a veil of delusion guru Knox's melting even the immortal whale Maya's last effort to derail the souls effort the final reality\n05:57 - now here comes the last verse which he says not for the sake of deathlessness I don't become a mortal for the sake of immortality not for the sake of deathlessness but for the sake divine\n06:12 - for divinity sick I take immortality not for immortality sake do I take him mortality this is a very fine philosophic this thing which we must I I give this turn to all my people because\n06:25 - you do have the moral spiritual and the realized high ground of all philosophy because they ended immortality but we don't not for the sake of deathlessness but for the sake divine transforming\n06:40 - this timeless space to realize my lord divine what is the timeless space what is this timeless space deathlessness because if your immortality is the timeless space\n06:54 - because if you are immortal your immortality is forever right so what do what is Gurunath call immortality the timeless space so he says not for the sake of deathlessness but for the sake\n07:06 - divine transforming this timeless space to realize my lord divine so there two words transforming and realize what does it do when he becomes deathless what does he do when he becomes deathless\n07:19 - when he becomes deathless there's nothing to do he's immortal fire cannot burn him the priest cannot dry him water cannot wet him instead weapons cannot pierce him he is the\n07:30 - immortal soul he's realized as his self realized but is not yet God realized because the self no matter how large it is still the self is still the eye is still the ego and therefore has to\n07:42 - translate from self-realization to God realization how is this transition made how is this transition done it is done by a certain alchemy it is transforming eternal space transforming immortality\n08:03 - into divinity and it trance he does this by the process of transformation the alchemy of Kriya yoga when he practices Kriya yoga he transforms this timeless\n08:17 - space which is deathlessness he transformed that this timeless space which is immortality or deathlessness into realization by Kriya yoga he transforms deathlessness into divinity\n08:35 - Heatran by transforming the timeless space he transforms immortality into divinity and in that transformation there is only one thing left I am the whole of this universe the\n08:54 - immortal being is so realized that he sees God through the divine mind but he does not see God as he is and to see God as he is you must transform divine mind into divine consciousness and therefore\n09:13 - the transformation of the divine mind into divine consciousness can be done by melting timeless space into God realization and this timeless space is compressed and purified and melted and\n09:31 - transcended by dissolving the ego the timeless space eternity and immortality of one in the same thing because they are both unending the ego is also unending whether you feel I am the\n09:45 - holder world where the eye is there this transformation by Kriya yoga practicing death transforms the ego into divinity transforming this timeless space he says transforming this timeless space\n10:05 - to realize my lord divine and this transformation is transforming the ego into divinity egolessness so this is what it is not for the sake of deathlessness but for the sake divine\n10:18 - transforming this timeless space to realize my lord divine so this is the point [Applause] I personally I've heard a lot of\n10:33 - beautiful poems I've heard this thing this thing is is pure quantum more metaphysics it's quantum physics because it goes to timelessness and death by death isolate death by death I use death\n10:48 - to conquer death now that is something when a person is walking in the jungles in India when we get a thorn in our foot people walk bare feet they take another thorn and take out the thorn with the\n11:00 - other thorn so it's a vaccination process use death to conquer death so it's it's very nice if you're the more you read it most not a poem to be just thrown aside\n11:12 - it's a great moral in the poem and it's really deep really deep yogi Yogi and yo grant what is your what is a yogi and what is the end of yoga it's all given in this poem\n11:23 - what is a yogi he practices dead what is the yoga it is transforming immortality into divinity and what is the end of end of yoga is to merge with the Lord yogi yogi and yoga and I practiced death\n11:43 - with bated breath became breathless to death by death I practice death with bated breath and became breathless to death by death and deathless have become and deathless have become I have become\n12:03 - immortal but deathlessness to me is not unless divinity is light shines forth deathlessness to me is not unless divinity is light shines forth melting even melting even the immortal veil\n12:25 - Maya's last effort to derail melting even the immortal whale because people have often understood immortality to be divinity and immortality to be god no there's a slight difference which I have\n12:39 - tried to point out so when the yogi he realizes that he's been some foot arched you know by Maya but deathlessness to me is not unless divinities light shines forth melting even the essential veil\n12:58 - Maya's last effort to derail the souls effort to final reality not for the sake of deathlessness but for the sake divine transforming this timeless space to realize my lord divine this is the point\n13:16 - that's you and this is me you've got to go together through eternity to search for that reality",

          "transcript": "00:02 - the only purpose of man's San on this Earth is to seek God and I can tell you all a secret which all of you know but nobody\n00:18 - knows because each individual translates the secret as for their own understanding this is called the Open Secret of spiritual knowledge I yes like you see the\n00:35 - Bible millions of people read the Bible but each one has their own interpretation of the Bible and nobody can tell the other you're wrong and I'm right no this is my\n00:49 - understanding of the Bible or bhagat Gita and that's your understanding of the bhagat Gita so each one is right according to the degree of\n01:01 - their evolution and the degree of their understanding of this subject which I am discussing today called Happiness everybody wants\n01:16 - happiness something that happiness you will get in Buddhism so they join Zen Buddhism some people think you'll get happiness in Christianity they join\n01:30 - Christian some people think they get Happiness by being a luan and they join the Lu they all are different Pathways you see but I not here to talk about happiness as much\n01:47 - as I am to give you happiness see many people talk about it but very few give it take this word happiness we will we will try to understand it by experiencing it so therefore I all want\n02:08 - you to to sort of drop your mind or set it aside and open your heart it's a small group and I'm giving you a foraste of what this happiness will be in your life\n02:22 - when you take charge of your life in many books you know on Psychiatry and psychology and the same I'm okay you're okay take charge of your life howdy howdy bdy bodyy Men Are from\n02:36 - Mars Women Are from Venus but what then so what they're from Venus and from Mars but then what oh then I don't know go to the next book so you going to read books so you\n02:54 - go to a restaurant you going to keep reading menu of the restaurant so you going to eat something you going to Stu So reading books is like reading the menu when you go to a restaurant and\n03:06 - experience is like eating the food you must order from the menu and eat so today we are here to order from the menu you know you have to you can't go to to\n03:21 - what's this Ruby Tuesday and you all know Ruby Tuesday it's got very good salad and good food right cuz there specialist shop a specialist\n03:34 - shopy where you can eaty to your liking and they give you very good treatment freshly squeezed orange juice and good salad and everything and all that and all\n03:46 - that so therefore reading books is like reading the menu now we've been reading the menu in America for too\n03:58 - long high Happ happiness low happiness sad happiness joy happiness this thing sorted happiness and all these different happiness happiness with Parmesan cheese happiness with so and so you have all\n04:12 - this happiness death by chocolate all these we reading about happiness and just give me example but who's going to make you taste\n04:23 - this so I am here to serve you as a servant of humanity and to serve you happiness which you will experience\n04:38 - provided you don't see the basic thing when I'm transmitting a certain energy or a certain aspect of the Divine love you must not be too thinking otherwise you'll get analysis paralysis you've got\n04:52 - your whole life to think and be paralyzed here sit like a child of five and give it a good try give it a try if the Yogi is saying he going to breathe through your breath give it a try I'll\n05:03 - breathe through your breath that's what I'm going to do today and those of you who've been with me for long and have had this experience of me breathing through your breath how many you have\n05:13 - had that experience raise your hands that's pretty good so all of you whove had it I'm going to breathe the Bliss in it for everyone but the others will just get the long breath and you'll get the\n05:23 - Bliss as well okay you have to go deeper and deeper and deeper into this experiment of bliss that is that's the crying need of the day because there is no Bliss there is\n05:37 - no happiness that could well be the cause of the extinction of the future Humanity not the melting of the ice but the emotional torment and the\n05:49 - lack of Happiness could be the cause of our own undoing or Humanity save yourselves and it's very simple I tell you it's it's very\n06:01 - simple be the architect of your own happiness the secret lies in the breath be I'm not telling you be Christian or be Muslim or be Hindu or\n06:16 - Buddhist I'm telling you be the architect of your own happiness the secret lies in the breath I'm not teaching you any anity no Christianity except\n06:40 - Humanity I'm not teaching you any ISM I'm teaching you Ness happiness is n it's all about you so the science of K yog is the science of breath it is not a religion or Creed dear brothers and\n06:59 - sisters it is a means whereby you can generate the Bliss from within you the answer lies within not in anything the answer lies within be the architect of your own happiness the\n07:15 - secret lies in your breath now you'll say what do you mean I am breathing already but I I'm not happy I feel like a grumpy old dmat I'm grumbling all the time and everybody's\n07:36 - treading on me and passing here and there with ignoring me that infuriates me I'm a grumpy old fellow but you see the Fountain of Happiness lies\n07:50 - within your problem is you're searching for happiness without you just have to do one thing turn Within look within when you look for happiness\n08:06 - without you're bound to be dissatisfied because all things without are perishable and when you look within it is your the spirit of your soul which is\n08:18 - Immortal I'm not speaking holy or spiritual mind you know I'm just trying to get to your depth of your Consciousness the nature of your inner being the nature of the Divine indweller\n08:27 - which you call Consciousness is happiness I so how do we tap this happiness which is within us this is the message I have come to give you today it is something\n08:40 - deeper it's about you it's telling you of a science of Kundalini k yog k yog is the science of breath be the architect of your own happiness the secret lies in your\n08:53 - breath by breathing rhythmically your mind calms down there is an intimate relationship between the mind and the breath if you will\n09:11 - see why must you pay attention to me why must you be interested because this is not about rocket science it's not not about astronomy it's it's not about uh climate change or real estate or money\n09:26 - or drugs it's none of these things you should be interested because it's about you selfing into the self about your it's about your well-being and your\n09:36 - happiness I'm not even talking about the general public or about God or Angels or anything I'm talking about you you are your own God you are your own Angel awaken the God within\n09:49 - you awake our sleeping image of God and manifest thy Divinity there should be the prayer we get up every morning awake oh sleeping image of God and manifest your\n10:00 - Divinity Divinity will arise within you so getting to this point that the breath and the mind are intimately\n10:17 - connected if the breath is calm and slow your thoughts which are monking around the fidgety thoughts the random thoughts will slowly subside if you do slow deep breathing it's the ancient\n10:36 - science of yog a little chip of which Jan fonder took and started some aerobic movement it is nothing but pray then America started arobic and F it is from PR now there's a new movement\n10:52 - palot now palotti is a form of yog asers they just call it palotti so these are small deviation from the main source so so much so that people being crazy after new things jumping after new events and\n11:07 - a new fad they forget the original that the source lies there and that Source lies within you so the science of breath is the original source for\n11:25 - happiness now when you see that you are breathing calm and slow your agitated thoughts become calm also that means your breath is controlling your thoughts and if you\n11:42 - breathe you know like before getting into the water there's one person who came we had gone to the Shasta Retreat and in the shastra retreat we went to a waterfall and that waterfall the water\n11:53 - was Subzero so this Jam got he got his clothes out and all and me and and another guy we also took our shirts out and all we said hey but wait a minute\n12:03 - before getting in let's ask this fellow who he is so he says oh I'm an international traine of the world this world lifu and life saving committee and I I swim the\n12:15 - alcatra without a swim without a wet suit every time I said okay wait a minute she said what are you doing he said this is a science of Indian PR which we were\n12:27 - taught to to eat up the body and creating the inner fire so he did that and the fellow jumped into the water ice cold water so I said boy this chap has been training night and day we're coming\n12:40 - swimming after a year and a half you jump in and it's done Eternal happiness so I said we don't want Eternal happiness just you\n12:51 - don't want to jump in and freeze your heart so all these things are done when they when they do this he was doing doing this heavy pranayam and I said what are\n13:01 - you doing he says this is agnisar this is an Indian pranayam which are the taught to people in extreme conditions taught to the Army taught to the astronauts taught to all people who go\n13:13 - under extreme conditions so pran is getting very popular at the very very high level but the people don't know it they call it aerobics so so this is not the not\n13:24 - aerobics it's not nothing about the breath or heavy breathing it's about the life force that moves your breath the current of your soul it's called Prana or Life Energy May the force be with you\n13:37 - says Y how many y raise your hands how many know how many know Santa Claus raise your hand how many know Mickey Mouse raise your\n13:49 - hands and now don't raise your hand how many know bush Okay so these guys are more popular now y says May the force be with you he doesn't know what he's talking about he\n14:07 - just if the words are put in his mouth in the Star Wars The Children See It excuse me I'm not a fan of that but my children grandchildren see it so I get to know some of this knowledge of Yoda\n14:17 - and Stars Wars and all that stuff it's pretty interesting not knowing that people can really travel there in Consciousness people can really travel to outer space in your Consciousness you\n14:28 - can travel at the speed of light but you see the fault ly here America's bre they've been to the Moon you can't take your luggage and baggage too long they try to travel with body and I salute\n14:40 - them for landing on the moon but beyond that sir it's going to get you got to shed your body and travel in your Consciousness an awakened mind will take you\n14:50 - there people have already been there so now when you see this getting back to the point of conscious iess and the life current and the pr the the breath when you breathe slowly your\n15:08 - thoughts become slow when you breathe agitated and fast like that swimmer was breathing and you jumped it your mind gets very alert excited and and any single thing it'll pick up and your\n15:21 - thoughts will be very alert they'll start activated your thoughts will get very active but by PR you can control them only thing your thoughts are uncontrolled\n15:30 - with pranay you can be alert with controlled thoughts and the random human being's thoughts are uncontrolled cannot control them\n15:42 - now when you're sitting by the now this is the control of the breath over the mind now the the control of the Mind Over the breath if you sit at the evening\n15:53 - Sunset calmly by the ocean side and watch the waves in the sunset your mind takes on the form of the sunset and the waves and becomes calm I then suddenly if you're told to get on\n16:08 - a horse immediately and Gallop because some uh Bandits are behind you and you're going full force come on Hur up your mind is very excited and nervous and agitated so the activity of your\n16:19 - mind the activity when you're quarreling with someone your mind does not calm so your mind controls your breath when you're quarreling with someone your breath is heing when you're active and\n16:30 - going on a horse your breath is heaving when you're sitting for meditation your breath is calm when you're sitting at the evening Sunset your breath is calm so your mind controls your breath and\n16:38 - your breath controls your mind I have you understood yes therefore I said be the architect of your own happiness the secret lies in your breath because you cannot always control your\n16:55 - mind by looking at a sunset mind is harder to control the breath through the life force is physical you see so with your breath you can control your mind it becomes calm\n17:29 - that's that's why be the architect of your own happiness the secret lies in your breath first there will come a tranquility and then in happiness right",

          "title": "Yogiraj Siddhanath's Full Moon Blessings April 23",
          "transcript": "00:03 - welcome everybody and God bless you my blessings are there with you for success and prosperity on your spiritual\n00:20 - journey today on this supicious full moon day the Sima Kumba MAA has begun for one month it began from the 22nd of April to\n00:40 - the 23rd of May this is an auspicious time when people all over the world they come to Sacred locations where they can\n00:56 - gain Merit and good karmas and get blessings for their spiritual progress from all the saints and sages all over the world the Kumba MAA as it is popularly\n01:15 - known is also known as the Sima the Sima happens every 12 years there's a arumba Simas that is a half Sima and a full Kum\n01:33 - Sim the full Kumba Simas happens every 12 years the half happens every 6 years and the story is lost in the night of prehistory it goes back thousands of\n01:47 - years tens of thousands of years where they say that in the Ancient of Days the gods and the demons they churned the\n01:58 - ocean for the nectar of immortality this churning of the ocean was known as samudra Manan samudra means the ocean and Manan means the churning for the\n02:15 - churning they used the great Cosmic Kundalini the serpent but you can call it anant or sh and and they\n02:32 - wrapped the sh nag around the suu mountain and the gods started pulling the snake from one side and the the demons uh the started pulling it from the other side and so the the mountain\n02:51 - was moving and churning the ocean and U this churning was pulling this the the anant the Eternal serpent The Serpent of Infinity uh in the ocean of in the waters of space for the wealth\n03:08 - of creation its Prosperity its Evolution its revolution and so on so forth It's a cosmic story later of course I'll tell you how\n03:21 - this can be an individual story and so when they started churning the ocean many gifts came from the the ocean and uh these wonderful gifts were shared you know amongst the the gods and\n03:39 - the demons actually they say demons and gods but it's like the churning it's like the Turning of The Wheel of Time where one faces Supreme deity that is the good\n03:50 - aspect of energy gods and the one we're turning The Wheel of Time away from the F the face of God is known as the negative forces so sometimes uh the positive forces when they turn in The\n04:03 - Wheel of Time they become negative and the negative become the positive but the wheel of the K chakra the the the the Spinning Wheel of Time and uh must go on and so in the in the churning all these\n04:16 - gifts came many jewels and emeralds and diamonds came from the ocean that's why it is known as ratnakar the maker of emeralds and diamonds jewelry came then beautiful Dam\n04:31 - came so the the wealth was shared by the people churning the great ocean of life and death and then Lakshmi came she was taken by Vishnu and\n04:43 - then nectar came and this was the Amrit which was taken by Vishnu and as they took it over it spilled its drops in four places in India the first was\n05:04 - harar which is up Northern India the second one is a little lower North which is called as alahabad or prayag the third place where the nect\n05:19 - was spiled was in uen near the Shipra River and the fourth was it tesar nashik these are the four places where the nectar of the gods were spilt and in these four places from time immemorial\n05:35 - great spiritual fairs great spiritual Gatherings are held every 12 years and the half simum the half Kumba MAA is held every 6\n05:49 - years so this year we have now entered the Simas theum because Jupiter has entered the sign of Leo Leo is simma so it's called Sima and it is entered it from 22nd April to 23rd of\n06:08 - May this one month is the Simas the officious time where you can meditate do your Kaa yog and get the blessings of all great Saints and sages and gods they will help you in your journey towards\n06:22 - the Divine and uh last of all in the in the churning of the great ocean came the poison known as halahal now all the gods are taken the jewelry\n06:39 - the wealth Prosperity Lakshmi was taken by Vishnu so who was going to take the poison so ultimately the poison then\n06:51 - Shiva came forward and he drunk the poison of the world the poison was called halahal and when Shiva drunk the poisons and the sins of the world to redeem\n07:03 - everyone and sacrifice that portion of him so that the world Evolution may go on he was known as Neil the blue throated because the poison of halahal which he\n07:15 - drunk uh caused his throat to be blw of course there's deep metaphysical and scientific explanation uh behind all this it's just put symbolically and it is encrypted in story and details so\n07:30 - that children can understand and people who want to tamper with the original metaphysical and scientific truths cannot touch it unless it is decoded it's all decoded it it it has to\n07:41 - be decoded anyway when you when you uh there was a wonderful uh poem that I made I'm not remembering now it is\n07:54 - called yes the Eternal Flame is in Silence the Eternal spark of life is in silence and all the worlds are still Evolution has\n08:04 - stopped but creation will only waken to Evolution when Mahadev has completed drinking the poisons of the world I will say that poem to you the Eternal\n08:17 - Flame is in zero so that the wheel of creation preservation and destruction and of evolution is is n immovable so it says the the world will\n08:38 - only awaken and Quicken to its Evolution and full potential when Lord Shiva has made the great sacrifice and drunk the the poisons and negativity of the world so that the world may go\n08:57 - on so this is the the story of Lord Shiva drinking the ultimate poison because of which our hold not our not our world or solar systems but the whole of creation exists because he made the\n09:09 - great sacrifice of removing the obstacles for the evolution of our creation which must ultimately go into his Supreme form called param Shiva however on this auspicious day I P\n09:25 - give it a a a subjective and personal interpretation I feel that every person every one of you who is doing Kaa yog now let us say the Kaa yog which is\n09:41 - done in the spine and the Kundalini which moves with the breath of Kaa is the Great Serpent of infinity which is minimized and miniaturized from from a macroscopic\n09:56 - scale to a microscopic scale is the Kundalini sh which is latent in every individual which we use in the evolution of our soul Consciousness which is the same thing\n10:07 - done in samr Manan by by by churning the Great Serpent of infinity you CH you churn your individual Serpent of infinity called the Kundalini and evolve your\n10:17 - Consciousness and as you do this churning the Kundalini moves up to the third eye and down to the base of the spine the suo mounted is the third eye the adna chakra where\n10:32 - the allseeing eye of Shiva or the Eternal son of Life the Surya the sun is there and the breath moves around the Sun and its nine planets located in the chakras so as the Crea breath goes on\n10:46 - and we move in the cycle of evolution many gifts are given to us you can by the power of your Sidis become rich gain wealth gain um Prosperity or you can if you desire you\n11:01 - can intent your mind on getting a beautiful wife and marry a beautiful uh lady who is a representative of the great mother Lakshmi who Vishnu had but then there are also the evil things of\n11:14 - intent which you are not being Shiva cannot drink it their malice hatred Revenge this thing can also come up in the churning of the ocean of Kaa yog but by the guru's grace any one of\n11:27 - your s gurus will take care of this and pass it on to babaii who neutralizes it in the kir sagur the ocean of of milk and honey so all these symbolic things have\n11:38 - very in-depth scientific meanings because much of the literature was stolen and destroyed by other lesser countries which were coming up and looking up to India as a beacon\n11:49 - of light that which they understood they took that which they couldn't or which went against their ideology they destroyed so therefore even the Crea yog secrets are kept and\n11:60 - encrypted and are not made for the meant for the profane they meant for everybody in the world those who are sincere and honest and would like to truly apply themselves to the science of the self to\n12:12 - know the self and so while you do the churning then comes a certain stage where the nectar appears now this nectar like so as in the cosmos so in the\n12:28 - individual body this what I feel and I learn as a direct disciple as a direct lover and a and a Savor of the great shiv goraka babai that in the human\n12:41 - body there is an inverted kumb or a well within which is the nectar like in the Cosmic Sphere there was the nectar which was taken by Vishnu it fell on four places\n12:55 - hardwar mahankal tesar uh nashik you know these these and alad so also that same nectar is in the human body\n13:09 - in within the the brain and it is produced from the thalmus and hypothalamus gland below which is the pitutary gland connected to which you can connect your tongue and\n13:20 - kri mudra and drink of the nectar of immortality and that is what the kumb is meant on the Cosmic Sphere they are also trying to drink the nectar of immortality by praising and devoting\n13:30 - themselves to the Lord God who will bless them with the nectar of immortality they do tapasa tapa meditation Karma yog Raj yog B yog Gan yog Mantra y Tantra yog Le yog and K yog\n13:44 - these are the means by which you can get to the nectar of immortality but immortality in itself is not the goal you become immortal you you become immortal because you want to have more\n13:55 - time in this physical body to meditate on the Lord God and get final MO so Divinity is more important than immortality but however when you do the practice of Kaa yog all these gifts come\n14:06 - to you the wealth Prosperity jewelry friends money name Fame they all come but that Yogi who is not distracted by these things he gets to the nectar of immortality but he is not distracted by\n14:23 - the nectar even of immortality I don't care my immortality is nothing says the truth Yogi the Raj Yogi the Kaa Yogi he says my immortality is nothing until I get to the Lord God\n14:35 - Supreme because for me Divinity is more important than immortality immortality is just a means to get to Divinity that I can stay longer in one lifetime so I complete my mission and see the Lord God\n14:47 - and experience him in the highest n nalp samadi in this very life I get my Moos that is one of the purposes of the nectar of immortality and that's what is the importance of the Kumba MAA which\n14:59 - Begins for for one year do your Kaa yog regularly this is very very important because that Kaa yog is the samudra Manan the Kundalini is tied around the the third eye the the Mount meu of the\n15:10 - third eye the Kundalini shaki is pulled by the positive forces of V which is the the ca upcoming and the negative forces which are the other forces it doesn't matter if I told you\n15:23 - now uh when you do this samudra Manan this churning of the ocean you do it in the turning of the the ocean of your CH Akash your mental sky and from your mental Sky develop all wealth and\n15:36 - prosperity and jewels and gems and and nectar and poison both so they come from your mind which is known as the the the the ocean of the Mind the mental Sky the inner Sky CH Akash and by churning the\n15:52 - Kundalini you get all the gifts reject everything I say and get only to the Supreme gift of all gifts which is the Lord God himself and with this my dear Souls be\n16:09 - Valiant and be brave I am in your breath I am helping you and moving with your each breath and thought if you come to me for help I will certainly not refuse you that help many of you have this\n16:23 - photograph of me or if you can call me mentally but sincerely if you call me then I will come and move through your breath and help you because I am one with your breath one with the universal\n16:33 - breath the pr the pran is the life force energy of each individual soul and with this God bless and God speed may you have a lot of prosperity\n16:48 - and happiness on your sour towards the Divine with this God bless I end this talk to you my voice will ever remain with you in your practice of Kaa yog so practice Kaa yog\n17:03 - practice any yog for that matter but get to the Divine goal do not be distracted by the Sidis of name Fame and wealth and money and even nectar get to the Lord God Supreme\n17:19 - [Music] [Music] [Music] and now to end it I will look into your eyes and give you the nectar of the Soul\n17:45 -

          "transcript": "00:10 - today i am going to speak to you about the nature of mind and its transformation its scientific\n00:24 - transformation into spirit i am going to make an endeavor to tell you how matter is transformed into energy energy is transformed\n00:41 - into mind mind is transformed into light and light is transformed into consciousness the yogic science which india has to offer to the world\n00:55 - especially that of kriya yoga is based purely on scientific fact and evolution now to begin with in the science of yoga we deal\n01:16 - with these facets of yoga these stages of yoga which are called young liam [Applause]\n01:34 - there are eight limbs eight sections to you that's why it is called ashtang with yoga now when you begin this scientific\n01:56 - process of yourself this science i have called the education of inner knowingness the nature of mind and the science of\n02:09 - spirituality is the education of inner knowingness how you can know yourself better by transforming yourself by gradual degrees\n02:22 - to your innermost nature which is pure awareness so the basic existence of man the basic nature of a human being is this physical body which\n02:38 - he keeps healthy with exercise yogasans proper diet he thereby keeps a fit body then he goes to his next body which is called\n02:57 - the fashionable or sensual body this sensual body is gradually also trained in life how to live your lifestyle by knowing the proper people\n03:11 - earning a good income getting a job marrying the proper person having a family where you can sublimate your senses and your passions to a\n03:21 - higher degree as a human being lives on he practices his yoga sense then he practices certain devotional chants\n03:34 - whereby his passions are transformed into emotions and his emotions are transformed into devotion and the devotion is transformed into love\n03:45 - so this is the story of the heart and the story of the from the physical we go to the emotional body the physical body the sensual passionate\n03:55 - body and then the emotional body and then you sublimate it further to make it a devotional body and for that we have practices called\n04:10 - the physical body you practice karma yoga for the emotional body of practice bhaktyo for the intellectual body you practice and for the final book she will practice\n04:23 - rajyo so these are the different scientific yog yogic methods to transform the physical to the emotional to the mental intuitional and spiritual bodies it's\n04:37 - done in a scientific way [Music] after the emotional body you read the scriptures you read intellectual books you read scientific books where you\n04:48 - refine the mind you train and tune your mind to higher perceptions of life and as you assimilate these higher perceptions\n04:58 - your mind becomes more and more in mind till it becomes so refined that it becomes almost merging into a state of awareness this is the gradual alchemy of total\n05:14 - transformation yo is the alchemy of total transformation of course the first basic yoke is do's and don'ts you know\n05:29 - self-directed austerity self-direct directed disciplines but when you get to the higher yoga after bhakti you get into the meditational yoga\n05:39 - this is what i'm going to speak to you about the nature of mind the states of samadhi and the science of spirituality now after you get into a state\n05:56 - of how samadhi which you get through devotional practices through bhakti yoga and pajamas you further go into a different nature of mind\n06:08 - when you try to study your mind now what is the nature of mind and what is the nature of mindfulness the nature of mindfulness is when the mind is focused\n06:34 - trained to tune itself to one object or one person without being distracted by any other object and your mind is totally filled with one\n06:52 - thought free from the distraction of any other thought this state of mind this nature of mind is called mindfulness which in yogic palace in yogic science we call khan\n07:08 - [Applause] the nature of this mind the nature of this mind the composition of mind this mind is of course molecular it is a molecular\n07:22 - mind it is well trained and well tuned and flows in one thought one train of thought in one direction\n07:33 - and when this mind effortlessly flows and one upon one thought saves the thought of an apple tree and it thinks of nothing but an apple tree\n07:46 - or it's a thought of the form of lord shiva and it thinks of nothing but lord shiva without any other distraction then the mind is said to be in\n07:57 - meditation which is called khan such a mind is called a mindful mind mindfulness you are in a state of mind fullness of course there are higher and higher\n08:15 - states which i will come to later in the state of mindfulness if you continue on your education of inner knowingness you will get to a deeper state\n08:31 - when you get to the deeper state of mindfulness you are focusing on the same object then you go from the molecular to the atomic\n08:46 - stage the mind becomes more refined and you are able to to go into a subtler atomic stage of electron proton and neutron\n08:57 - that is the composition of your mind in a state of the samadhi which is the vitar so vitar samadhi means reasoning\n09:14 - logical introspection where you are seeing the form of lord shiva the moon on his head the name associated with the form is shiva\n09:26 - the meaning of the name and the attributes so the mind just focuses on that then the mind goes from vitaraka samadhi i'm of course simplifying the states of\n09:38 - samadhi for you and correlating it with the substance that that samadhi is composed of it's very scientific it's very concrete so you can grasp the role\n09:52 - this is the process of meditation of dhyana is basically molecular we are aware of the molecules in our mind the process of the first stages of samadhi and which\n10:03 - is because they go to a subtler state i'm not going to go into the details i'll try to make it as simple as possible\n10:14 - then you go then your consciousness goes to a deeper level from the samadhi to vichaar samadhi where it goes to the subatomic level your mind from the\n10:24 - atomic level is broken down to the subatomic level of electron protons and neutrons so the molecular mind in khan the atomic mind and the\n10:35 - dark samadhi and in samadhi it is the subatomic strata your mind becomes subtler and subtler the constituents of your mind by the process of a constant\n10:46 - meditation constant focus on the object of your study refines your mind and when you get to the subtler state of vichaar then your one flow of thought\n11:04 - it is at this stage that you can see only the object of shiva and you forget yourself the moment you forget yourself\n11:20 - you are one with shiva there's one only there's no you and shiva there's only shiva you and shiva are one this in yogic plants\n11:27 - is called samyam where the subject and the object become one it is called samyam and from mindfulness you transit to a deeper state of\n11:38 - soulfulness where the inner attributes where the attributes of the soul express themselves to you and then your mind is one homogeneous fabric\n11:54 - of radiant ether and you go to a deeper state where the mind is not hardly mine it is more subtle and it is so subtle that it is merely\n12:13 - electro protonic the neutron is received it is removed the neutron is removed now when the neutron is removed you only have an electrophotonic mind\n12:28 - in a state of ananda which is the third state of samical where floating in a bliss of joy you are partially integrated with that state but when you become\n12:44 - totally integrated with that state there is no eye the ego disappears but you are still in a state of soul fullness and your consciousness has expanded\n13:01 - then the mind becomes subtler and more refined by constant years of meditation with the constant practice of ananda samadhi you go to a deeper state of a smith\n13:15 - samadhi where you go and realize that all of this is me i pervade the whole world i am in every twitter of the world i am\n13:28 - in the clouds i am in the sea your awareness expands to the whole of the relative creation and then you can see that all of this that exists is me\n13:41 - so this is a subtle state of mind a very subtle state of mind and here this is the ultimate state of knowing relativity you can see god you can see a splendor\n13:57 - but through a purified state of mind this purified state of mind which is almost as pure as the atma this purified state of mind is the buddhi\n14:07 - which is called the holding of the divine knowledge the bearer of truth's mind the holder of divine knowledge knowing everything there is to know in the\n14:18 - universe so this state of a smith samadhi is known as where your consciousness pervades the whole relative universe but you are still in\n14:29 - mind now comes this the crucial state the constitution of the mind as it gets subtler from the molecular state it becomes subtler and more expensive\n14:42 - expansive into the atomic state from the atomic state it becomes subtler and more expansive in the atomic stage the subatomic state as is in the samadhi then from the subatomic state\n14:58 - even the elect neutron and proton disappear and you only only one vast electron your samadhi is one homogeneous fabric of radiant\n15:12 - data one electron one capacitor electron in a form of relativity you are in a state of soulfulness you have known the mysteries of nature\n15:26 - you have known the truth of nature this is the science of mind as by constant meditational techniques and yogic practices it transforms itself from the molecular\n15:36 - state to the atomic state to the subatomic state and this goes to the radiant state of radiant ether the one electronic state but now from\n15:48 - the electronic state it has to become light the electron is the particle and the light is the wave so at the edge of time\n15:57 - unveiling the edge of time you still have to pass through the stargate where you are shifting from sabikal samadhi to nirvikalpa samadhi from the electro\n16:08 - electronic mind to the light mind the lightning mind so you're making the paradigm shift from the electron to light from the materialistic particle\n16:20 - to the spiritualistic light which is half spiritual and half material now light is the crucial juncture light is matter at its subtlest end\n16:36 - which merges into spirit and matter is light at its grossest level of iridium the rock the mud the earth element\n16:47 - so the yogic method transforms you not only from man the man to ban the fruit to man man the groot to man the man to man the god but it also transforms you\n16:57 - from matter to energy to light to consciousness this is the science of spirituality this is the nature of the mind practice dear souls do not let any\n17:08 - moment go by now the crucial state is reached where the electron the one electron has to speed up and become the wave the particle electron has to become the\n17:22 - wave of light this is the wave particle duality which is confused and perplexed many a researcher of truth yogis and scientists alike but without\n17:35 - practice you can't make the transition from mindfulness to soulfulness when you have one electron when you have sabikal samadhi in relativity and soulfulness and the\n17:46 - transition from soulfulness to consciousness is the transition from the particle to light it's very subtle sometimes they had the wave particle come together\n17:59 - but the world is still confused the normal world the scientific world as to whether this creation is a wave or a particle so now in order to do this there's a\n18:09 - catch-22 you have to have no desire your mind has to be pure if you try you're making an effort it's a desire you don't pass through the\n18:18 - stargate from the molecular electron to the wave of light if you try you're making an effort so that's a desire if you don't try you\n18:29 - don't move because you're not making any effort so you have to wait for gravity guru the gravity and as the gravity of your awareness\n18:40 - increases by a constant focus a constant focus on the purity of being when your mind becomes as pure as your atma when your buddhi becomes as pure as your\n18:52 - atma then the atma by the virtue of its own gravity swallows of the buddhi transforms the buddhi into atma and sucking itself inside out through\n19:03 - the stargate of the third eye it transforms matter into spirit it transforms buddhi into atma but the atma is still surrounded by a very thin film of\n19:16 - materialism which is called light this is very very important so you are in a state of enlightenment but the desires of your past life form this thin\n19:28 - film of resistance which prevent you from going into total consciousness you're in samadhi but you're you are not in the absolute\n19:41 - consciousness but this is the journey of the soul covered by the nature of the mind and as the soul works its way inside out it transforms the mind as the atma works\n19:55 - its way inside out it transforms the buddhi into the atma itself and the atma merges into paramatma this is the science of the\n20:04 - soul this is the nature of mind and spirituality now even the light [Music]\n20:13 - is matter at its subtlest half merged into consciousness and hearted matter only when you forgo your last desire your last desire is\n20:28 - complete and fulfilled then you go into a state of the seedless samadhi where the gravity of the earth can be sucked in and gravitated into you\n20:45 - where the space-time continuum will no more be because then you once there is no thought no light once there is no light when you\n20:55 - enter the lightness light time stands still light and its causation disappear and space time and light become one they disappear into the great void\n21:09 - into the great mahankar into the great beyond time into pure consciousness but those who know it tell it not those who tell it to it not\n21:20 - i am here just pointing to you the way of the science of the mind the nature of the mind the scientific nature of the mind and spirituality\n21:29 - so the mind and the spirit the physical body the energy the mind the light and the consciousness are essentially all ones and the process\n21:44 - of the alchemy of transformation the alchemy of total transformation this process is called the rajyo kriya yoga\n21:58 - with this i conclude [Music] the sound that transforms because the universe is vibration and home is vibration it transforms your\n22:15 - subtlest karma which are your subtlest thoughts of your past life and past world cycles into pure light and then to consciousness\n22:27 -

from the physical to the TiVo sensual body and from the sensual body or the emotional body it's an aspect of your consciousness from the emotional body to your mental body the body is thought the\n00:55 - mental body to the intellectual body from the intellectual to the intuitional body and then to the soul body see so all these are the asset of consciousness through her more refined and ever more\n01:17 - expanded spheres of consciousness you see the self or the soul the spark the spirit it gets to the soul will travel through a more refined and my expanded spheres of consciousness to get to the\n01:33 - core of one's own being to get to the goddesses which lies at the core of one's own being with these various stages if I'm honest enlightened you know the effort of you the movement of\n01:53 - consciousness to a role and his boat so what is concentration length concentration is the repeated practice of bringing your attention back to the object of your meditation\n02:15 - but every time you do this it's like it's an effort it's it's like when a person is weighing a Morgan effort you just like concentration the effort is\n02:30 - bringing bringing the attention back you know to the solely but the object of one's attentions that is your consciousness okay then from your consciousness get possible outward and\n02:51 - you bring it back so rowing with effort is like concentration concentration rowing without this is very important to understand and as you go with effort you become so used to it that your movement\n03:17 - becomes effortless you don't have to the momentum is effortless which is meditation so these are various means concentration is like rowing with effort meditation as\n03:43 - will rowing effortlessly whether with the gross and the horse become one Samadhi is like samyama in the world and the awe of the row become one and then enlightenment is when for the body and\n04:08 - the roar of the boat vanish into the ocean of consciousness so this concentration meditation and Samadhi how do you are in these stages we go through various stages the first\n04:27 - state of Samadhi this quadrant samadhi of illogical introspection it is like an inserting between the object you are fixed on you fixed on an object of Lord Shiva and then we are thoughts only\n04:54 - focused on four things you you look at the object of Lord Shiva you think about the attributes of not Shiva and so on so forth then your thoughts are moving between the attributes of Lord Shiva\n05:12 - what are the raw attributes compassion mercy destroyer of our demon say you have these attributes so this is what will be done without the samadhi and from that you reach an intermediate\n05:29 - state people live with a Samadhi Samadhi very physical form Shiva is there with attributes the physical form of Shiva is on there at the first stage of Samadhi\n05:48 - we're totally fixed you partially become Shiva at the first stage of samadhi be that and then it did little Somali you don't really become one with Shiva's for this no there's no Vedic you are one\n06:06 - with if you're experiencing has formed the moon on your head you have absorbed at once your concentration meditation and Samadhi have become one then in the which are somebody who just read\n06:25 - introspection deep focused awareness you have passed from the first state where consciousness is partially of his physical form effortlessly and then it totally becomes his physical form then\n06:47 - as you go to the next Samadhi which is the recharge some of the of deep run fluid focused awareness of thought focused awareness of thought is you cross over the physical body and get to\n06:60 - a deeper state where you go to the attribute which is which are near each other that is a focused awareness you partially focus taking awareness becomes this quality you know if sacrifice\n07:20 - destroyer ready money you are partially that they are father's dead but you have partially inherited the qualities and in that second stage of the charge Samadhi\n07:36 - you totally inherit his quality of destroy already month he destroys the negativity and redeems the ego at this level of awareness but this is for thoughts for the\n07:59 - physical form the first stage for the random thoughts they all focus on Shiva had become totally Shiva in thought and form third stage of Samadhi Samadhi Samadhi Ananda near on on their venom n\n08:14 - equal to tan and Samadhi then you have his physical form you have become his thought of redemption and sacrifices with up now you have to become his attributes beyond the thoughts of his\n08:28 - good qualities of the Saviour of the joy that he wins bliss Satyam Shivam Sundaram the beautiful Shiva Lord Shiva giving joy after he redeems after he destroys all the negativity and is it\n08:44 - the process of redeeming you the next highest stages he gives you the Bliss then you lose or you you absorb this physical form and his thoughts and go to the the positive attribute of joy that\n09:02 - is what forms are to be conquered hearings or thought and form are of Shivan your thoughts are with you forms this is the focus of him your subtler thoughts are filled and you have two\n09:20 - beautiful joy such it are none them so are none is also yours in the third stage is that clear darkness any that's the deeper stage of samadhi here your rajasic ego and your negative equals of\n09:35 - would describe the neutron and protons of would destroy you transit is right at the first stage of somebody protons are destroyed another someone that is the rajasic course\n09:51 - now the fourth stage of Somali this is all the samadhi of savikalpa samadhi the samadhi with attributes three-dimensional some of what state of Samadhi is the samadhi of a smith\n10:06 - samadhi after anand and iran and you get to a smith samadhi they your consciousness expands and you feel that you are a part of his existence consciousness and bliss but you don't\n10:22 - feel you are of all of it as yet and after you more different people from being a part of his existence is consciousness in his bliss a part of the mind and matter of the whole of creation\n10:36 - as you go deeper then you become the universal undifferentiated fabric of radiant ether light where you are his existence consciousness and bliss in its entirety in his holiness so the fourth\n10:58 - stage of the three dimensional saw body and he reigns believe that dimensional samadhi no bliss on this earth can be greater no fortune can be bigger and no blessings can be more peaceful and\n11:14 - satisfying than this stage of savikalpa samadhi which is called a mass with samadhi or savikalpa samadhi here you have known God entirely through the crystal mind your pure mind you can see\n11:31 - God through your pure mind very clearly on his details but you are still in the third dimension your state is very high you are then known as the property level means the divine soleus was merged\n11:49 - himself in all the atoms of creation and can feel himself vibrating in every atom of creation to the far limits of the matter of the universe it's a very great\n12:01 - stage but still you are seeing God has said to none on the existence consciousness of this but yet but still you are seeing him through divine mind so you have to break the mirror of the\n12:16 - mind to get to the state of divine consciousness which is beyond the three dimensional limits of the mind and matter of this universe you are still in the Rings past not you have not passed\n12:29 - the little spots not and this is the stage where you can see the attire put us the journey of creation and individually within you you can see it as the pale intense golden trim the true\n12:45 - center and this central point of the five-pointed stars so you see father as the star son Krishna consciousness as the blue and the Creator has the golden limb in all its entirety you are able to\n13:04 - grasp the whole of creation and all his mysteries you you you see who trust the Chaitanya and you are at the stage of savikalpa sadi everything that it can be thought of can be can be active on this\n13:25 - in this creation everything that can be thought of as spoken of thought what a deal is known to you and your mind has become as pure as purity itself it that becomes\n13:43 - Ritambhara means the bearer of truth the mind is the holder of the truth of reality nothing is hidden from your side whatever you focus your mind on that mystery shall be no hundred but you are\n13:58 - still in the great Maya you have not passed the rings past not because your divine mind no matter how I have a pure and clear is still the divine mind and that mind is held in\n14:15 - bondage by the relativity of the universe you're still in relativity now the next transition which is the quantum Lily you have to exist from relativity\n14:30 - to reality and to exist and to exist from relativity to reality individually you must penetrate the five-pointed star of your third eye which is called the who does the tread\n14:47 - onion the chain not me has to be penetrated because your mind is so crystal clear that it is called the bearer of divine truth which means the Ritambhara the bearer of divine truth it\n14:59 - has all the knowledge of all the stars and on the planets of all science all what human beings thing what would they do all the wealth of the universe is at your feet or the joy is within your\n15:12 - reach but that which is incomprehensible is not in your age because you have a perfectly divine mind called the bearer of truth the Ritambhara and it is so crystal that you can even perceive God\n15:27 - through your crystal divine mind as such in a non existence consciousness and bliss within this entire three-dimensional world you are totally self-realized at this\n15:44 - stage of savikalpa samadhi but you are not as yet God realized how to get to the stage of hot realization you must pass through the tunnel of the timeless time and the lifeless light\n16:06 - and the horseless cause the tendon of the first discourse at the time this time of the night this light is the temple of the five star of the throne I the five pointed star which represents\n16:21 - the five elements the fiber mantras now hear the challenges that if you try to penetrate the star you will be unsuccessful because any desire or any effort will contaminate your journey to\n16:49 - the spotless lesson done on the Immaculate this has to be an immaculate conception from the three-dimensional relativity's the world of three-dimensional relativity to the we\n17:04 - know not what of the supreme reality so if you make an effort it is a desire to reach that state of the solitary singularity so you will not be able to penetrate the stuff if you do\n17:25 - not make the effort and just be you know else you will be where you are because you are making no effort so this is the catch-22 the Tank Army of reaching the Supreme God from self realization\n17:52 - Devolder a decision if you try you will not succeed as a desire if you don't try you will not succeed because it's a desire of not trying see you have to have no desire for trying and no desire\n18:12 - for you will not try you just have to be the Venus of your bead and then they come will come a time where all your past good karma or deeds will be marshaled up\n18:32 - before the Supreme the Divine Mother and she will remove herself she is the ultimate sound Adi the sound of creation now you must remember that all your desires have been removed in thought\n18:56 - word and deed your single random desires have been cleared from your mind snake your thought forms have been cleared from your minds later your remembered experiences have been cleared from your\n19:15 - minds lake but the remembered experiences of your past lives have not been cleared from your minds lake and you're dead to creation has not been cleared so therefore that depth of\n19:35 - creation will be cleared after you get to the stage and wait you may have to wait and then your past life tense when you penetrate the star by the grace of the Guru and the grace of the Divine\n19:59 - Mother this happening shall take place the happening of karma make Sahana will come first and then all if I'm a quality the veil not all designs because you've already cleared his ass the veil shall\n20:26 - be removed the Great Wave of the three-dimensional world shall be removed and the removing of that way will clear you will get you into the clear lightless light when that weight is\n20:40 - removed then you will start going through the tunnel and then you reach a stage coordinate the seedless Sumati way even your past life your past life experiences can be removed but for that\n21:00 - you know constantly have to go to see it less Samadhi and back again because past life experiences will pull you down so this is known as temporarily difficult samadhi or temperately a sub Frontenac\n21:11 - samadhi but when all your past life has been cleared even if you go through the tunnel you'll be coming back go through the tunnel coming back then after that it's clear that you would\n21:20 - reach a permanent state of net worth of samadhi of permanent state of Assam brodnik samadhi which is called the seedless Amma I even in the seedless Samadhi as you stand before the solitary\n21:33 - singularity very similar to the solitary singularity he had not wanted it this mystery nobody knows because that mystery the kunais themselves of which the whole creation is me do not remember\n21:49 - experiences of your past life but the remembered experiences of the of the past life and of the beginning of the creation the beginning of BIGBANG which is called the three gunas the electrons\n22:04 - protons the neutrons the subatomic particles they had a subtle aspect is superlative of gunas and when those who knows are removed then you merge into the solitary singularity and are not\n22:18 - realized this is a very subtle subject and I must say I have not explained this perfectly it's really good in words to explain this you know very very few people know that when they\n22:38 - have gotten to the solitary singularity of kaivalya do people return or do they not return this is the mystery which only he knows about whom we do nothing so what what I mean to say is even\n22:59 - people after they about realize they reach the seedless Somali beyond the third male they reach the seedless Somali that is near beach Salam before the beach and this thing stands the\n23:13 - predict result so after they want to protect herself that is the whirling back of all creation into his cortex that is the stage when position space and time he would not exist\n23:29 - causation space and time do not exist even after the first stage when you reach they will meet some other also they go Texas that you have got caught realized but even beyond that there's\n23:43 - the stage of the Total Immersion and these are the stages that consciousness pure consciousness the spirit of your consciousness means he about whom we know nothing and he is\n23:57 - worthless so to make an effort to penetrate the star is not a good idea do not make an effort is not also a good idea with ideas second observation I just just have to be this have to be and\n24:13 - he would not want not have the desire to be what with God not not have the desire to be one with God no have the desire to be one with but just wait for guru chroma\n24:26 - guru Baba you mean we're his Koopa where's grace grace his confidence to shadow a word and hit something heavy I don't know where his guru Akasha is his gravity the import of\n24:41 - his grace shall descend upon you and by the very gravity of the happening you should penetrate the stop first is the individual star then is the cosmic star which lies at the center of the\n24:53 - singularity of every galaxy and there's a super singularity in the middle of creation having penetrate that penetrated that you are eternal bliss and unspeakable unbound joy and truth\n25:08 - which cannot be described in any human words no any divine words this is the journey of the soul consciousness through various stratas of the individual you know physical body that\n25:26 - sensual body emotional body mental body into intellectual body into tional body spiritual body then going to the cosmic merging into the cosmic physical body the cosmic then transcending and\n25:42 - realizing cosmic physical body then the cosmic sensual body the cosmic emotional body the cosmic mental body the cosmic intuitional body intellectual body the cosmic intuitional\n25:56 - body and the cosmic spiritual body and then merging into at that point on card results there are seven infinities in creation first infinity of what you do is have enough\n26:42 - Samadhi only as a purposely light would like a paramount swamp let's first the vanadium with input at the third stage of so on and so on the in it at a Smith Samadhi is the property\n26:58 - line and from the property level you pass on to the thing of the complete cards did you pass beyond the stage of course you pass beyond three dimension you pass beyond the stage of the Devas\n27:12 - yes when you die what is it not by the ones over in the final pin to access because you're still identifying yourself with the body and your soul is in slumber because it doesn't become a\n27:36 - kid my career you but now you have a weakening your soul baby normally you will be known as that's the speak his mind goes to sleep with his body and his soul goes to sleep with his\n27:46 - mind you have to keep your mind awake even after the body dies you can see people preventing everybody is you can look at it like this Oh death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory\n27:60 - this you stay there the end of Sonic R so here is a Smith sorry P so there's an individual star penetrated the so cosmic star penetrated individual stars been penetrated after sudden and after these\n28:15 - they're the state of you go to the individual pedestrians after that which are passing states yes",

          "transcript": "00:13 - so today on this auspicious full moon day I will be giving you a small blessing and a talk\n00:32 - on birth and [Music] death and the life after death some people had also asked\n00:45 - me what is the role and how relevant is the practice of yog and especially Kaa yog in the process of EXP editing the evolution of the\n01:02 - [Music] soul in the natural process of life after death so we I'll give you a brief as to what life after death would entail and then I will talk about how by the\n01:16 - practice of yog you can expedite your Evolution and don't have to go through all the processes of the life after [Music] death it is said\n01:32 - that birth and death are mere chapters in the life story whilst you as the river of livingness flow\n01:51 - on many of births and deaths have you been through but you the immortal Atma the Divine Li livingness flows on threading through it all the various personalities of life after\n02:09 - life and death after death so you must get this firmly fixed in your mind I'm going to take off get more comfortable so life and death\n02:31 - are your chapters birth and death are your chapters in the life story whereas you as the river of livingness flow on you the Atma are\n02:46 - Immortal the fire cannot burn it the water cannot wet it the weapons cannot pierce it the breeze cannot dry it for the soul is Immortal perfect and untainted as it\n03:03 - goes through its journey of reincarnation till it works out all its karma and gets to a straight state of the Karma free state of liberation of\n03:21 - Enlightenment called Mo so when a person passes through his life story he accumulates all the various karmas physical emotional mental and\n03:45 - divine corresponding to all the Locas or the ples of existence Bo that is the physical plane bhah that is the astral plane swaha that\n04:00 - is the Heavenly plane so as it travels in its daily life it accumulates a sum total of physical passional emotional mental and intuitional\n04:22 - Karma it also works many of these karmas or these Deeds is Deeds are actions and reactions so he does some actions in this life whose\n04:39 - reactions can be paid off in this life or sorted out in this very life right but some of the actions of the uh reactions of the actions are not sorted out so\n04:53 - when the human body is old and dies the soul passes out of the body and enters what it called into the after death state of life the life after\n05:11 - death and it enters into the first stage for 72 hours or 3 days it is on the Earthly plane which is called PR Lo or mul Lo is the plane where people are bound to die that means this Earth\n05:28 - plane after 72 hours the soul is able to disengage itself from the physical body but is still in the tramel of the senses so now all its sensual desires\n05:47 - remain covering the soul with its emotional and mental desires too it roams for 10 days in the lower astral world or in limbo called the pishacha\n06:05 - Lo the first stage of the Bardo of course as I've told you before that the Bardo tool and the Book of the Dead all these ideas were taken from India from the famous book of gud\n06:20 - puran and the brahmanical rights of the Dead which are performed by the brahmans of India even today after a person is expires his soul is given rest peace and onward spiritual progress by certain\n06:37 - rights called the Shad so when this Soul after 3 days passes from PR Lo the the plane or the the state of De the dead it goes into the state of uh nature Spirits GS the\n06:57 - limbo the pachic state the Lower State state of the [Music] B here it Tes and Carries for 10\n07:09 - days during these 10 days certain rights are performed which are spiritual mantras and certain rituals which help to loosen the vibrations of the Sensual Body which covers the emotional mental\n07:28 - and intuitional bodies and within all these bodies resides the Atma The Immortal you the spirit of your soul so these vibrations are done by the process of sh as I've told you I won't\n07:44 - go into the details I'll just go uh give you a passing reference because if you want to go into the details you have a former video of mine called the life\n07:57 - after death so then it passes to the pishacha the lower astral plane where it grosser desires are\n08:12 - fulfilled and by mantras you see everything is vibration in the universe so by one sort of vibration which the brahmans chant during the the death ceremony of the sh there they are those\n08:25 - type of vibrations which loosen the desires of the pachic vibrations the desires of the altergeist the lower Spirits those vibrations which are holding on to the the soul the soul\n08:38 - which has the nature of a low Spirit covered by these vibrations those vibrations are loosened by the other Vibrations by constant resonant frequency it's a very scientific\n08:52 - method then the Soul passes on relieved from its grosser vibrations of sensual desires it passes onto the next plane which is the\n09:05 - astral plane the emotional plane B in this astral plane from the pishacha Yoni from the birth of the lower altergeist of spirit it goes into the emotional\n09:21 - plane from the pishacha pishacha it goes to the poni the state of the lunar and sests actually the 13th day is the last day where people finish with this reading of\n09:36 - the bhagwat Gita vibrations reading of the guran vibrations to release the soul from from pishacha that is the the the state of lower spirits to the state of the ancestors P our ancestors are\n09:53 - forefathers and when it goes to P you see in this all its emotions and certain Noble desires which were unfulfilled get fulfilled and all\n10:09 - actions which it has done for which other people are responding to the actions which where you have to pay off your karmic Leisure like you do an\n10:24 - action there's a reaction there's an action there's a reaction so this karmic law takes place and those actions which have not not been paid for which have not been atoned for are atoned by the\n10:34 - next series in pit lo you see the the locco or the plane of the ancestors you see when Buddhism spread from India to Tibet and then to China\n10:46 - and then to Japan they all have these funeral rights for the ancestors of course they are a reflection of what happens in India so those rights are not very complete and more diluted form\n10:58 - whether they do it by rice and water offerings to ancestors when you do this the next vibrational quote the emotional quot of karma which is covering the\n11:14 - soul that quote gets dissolved by the constant Mantra and vibrations which you do after the 13th day now these this will last for one year till the next\n11:29 - [Music] date of sh the next date where the soul had given up the body the soul then travels on his journey from\n11:45 - pra and then it goes to the final state from the ancestors to the state of the Gods the secondary Gods the dasas The Shining ones all its good karmas it it pays off the debts of its good karmas\n12:00 - and fulfills those good karmas which are due to it if it has done a lot of good deeds It suffers uh it it U sort of utilizes and enjoys the blessings of those good\n12:14 - deeds so after the cycle is over then the Soul enjoys the Heavenly spheres the paradise the purer the soul the longer it stays in this heavenly Paradise it\n12:33 - may stay 50 years 100 years 400 years 4,000 years depending upon the gravity and a soul which enjoys so much of Good Karma usually doesn't have to suffer the\n12:46 - usually the Lesser or the grosser karma then from there it starts its descent onest descent it comes straight from the Heavenly spheres to the astral spheres from the astral to the etheric\n12:60 - and then takes birth into the womb of a Divine mother a good mother that is the whole cycle of life after death in brief and when it returns a lot of storage of its past\n13:16 - Karma which is known as the stored the collective subconscious where its prab the karma stored up karma is and each life is given a portion of its to up Karma stored up karma is called the\n13:31 - sanchit karma and that portion of that huge Collective Karma which is given in each individual life reincarnating life is called prab karma so it comes with its next set of prab the karma it\n13:46 - descends down from the Heavenly spheres from swaha B B B and B so Heavenly sphere astral sphere and Earthly sphere and then it\n14:01 - takes birth again into the womb of a mother and is reborn again till the next set of karma goes on so this cycle of birth and death this reincarnational cycle Carries On\n14:16 - Till all the not only the prabha karma of this life is exhausted but also the sanit karma of all its past lives is exhausted and this may take take a very\n14:30 - long time for those Souls who are very engrossed in materialism it may take less time for those Souls who are meditating and purifying their physical etheric astral\n14:45 - that is emotional mental and intuitional bodies now we come to the next stage now the next stage what is the\n15:02 - relevance of K [Music] yog in the life after [Music] death what I have told you people that\n15:13 - those who practice Kaa yog sincerely or any form of Raj yog or any type of yog their evolution is hastened and they don't go through the same rigar of the life after\n15:28 - death the journey is cut short and they go to the Eternal aboard the Haven of Peace called Brahma niran or Nan MOA that is the final salvation because they have already\n15:44 - worked out their grosser karma their negative karma in this living body by the practice of Kaa yog Raj yog Gan yog or bti yog these are the different types of\n15:58 - yoges they differ in their speed of evolution K yog which is essentially Raj yog is said to be the lightning path and therefore gives you the fastest Evolution so when you sit down to\n16:13 - practice what happens when a Kaa Yogi he sits down to practice he first deals with his physical body his physical Karma he does his proper yogic exercise\n16:30 - he has a proper healthy diet conducive to good meditation and pranayam and with that he perfects his physical body on this physical Earth making it healthy and strong to practice\n16:44 - the higher forms of yoga so first is diet and physical postures which are called gasta yog not hat yog gasta yog means means the Yoke of the physical\n17:01 - body the gut the physical body and with proper exercise yogas and diet he perfects this body in this very life then he goes on to the next stage\n17:15 - but the satra stage of his passions his emotions now these passions and senses these passions which which torment him or worry him through the\n17:28 - senses or make him distracted through the five sense telephones of sight taste smell hearing that is sound and touch these senses must be brought in control and they are physically brought in\n17:42 - control by a disciplined Life by the practice of repetitive vibrations called mantras they repetitive patterns of vibrations called mantras and these repetitive patterns of vibrations smooth\n17:59 - and sort out the negative vibrations of fear lust greed jealousy hatred aice malice all these negative dark vibrations which are inherent in the natural human being are cleansed by the\n18:18 - power of mantras that is a pattern of vibrational sound for example a mantra om my now if I produce these vibrations in my body and mentally they have sure to have\n18:54 - an effect on the negative slower D vibrations and dissolve them push them out of existence change the cycle CPS cycles per second of that vibration and raise the\n19:10 - vibration to a state of light to a state of Purity therefore the importance of Mantra yog in the evolution of human consciousness which also shortens the\n19:22 - Journey of the life after death and after you do this then you get on to higher States when you get to the emotional body from the physical body you get to\n19:31 - the emotional from the Sensual Body of lust greed the shadow repus you get to the emotional bodies where you have emotional suffering sorrow pain you have a certain greed you still have refined\n19:46 - qualities of those brosser sensual qualities which you use the power of Life Force energy called pranayam and when you use the pranayam in the yogic way\n19:60 - then it is very beneficial it burns the seeds of past evil karma which are latent in the chakras of your spine this is very important and this is effective at\n20:17 - the uh pan Kos the monicos which is the astral body so the emotions are purified and turned into devotions this is the astral body which is purified by\n20:31 - pranayam and by mantras then from the manomay co you go to the Vian which is the mental body that is from pitra lo you go to the lower Da Lo the astral body is P or the\n20:48 - astral lunar ancestors then you go to the solar ancestors who reside in the in the mind in the Vian\n20:59 - in D Lo the the Dave Lo and when you go into the D Lo the land of The Shining ones there also you have the mantras like the gatri Mantra the Maham Mantra but this is done in the with the\n21:10 - accompaniment of breath known as Sagar pranayam the pranayam which contains the seed sound of the Mantra pranayam which does not contain the seed sound of a mantra is known as nigar pranayam the\n21:23 - pranayam which contains the seed sound of the Mantra is known as Sagara pranayam this is used to cleanse and purify the D Lo body called the vidan you see all these bodies have a\n21:37 - system of purification which is practiced in the science of Kaa yog and therefore the relevance of Kaa yog in your day-to-day life to cut short your life after death\n21:48 - the Journey of the Soul after death is cut short because you are working out your positive as well as negative karmas In This Very life and then you go to the higher the intuitional body or the budik\n22:03 - body the higher body is also very very important and over there you visualize light you visualize sound and you visualize vibration the triple Divine s uh quality of the\n22:22 - Omar you do the Omar Kaa The Shiva Shakti Kaa and burn your past evil k which are latent in your body and your spine then you still the ripples of thoughts in your mind's\n22:36 - lake so that the soul Swan the hamsa may fly out from your third eye into the Spheres of the eternal spirit me you are getting MOA In This Very life you don't have to go through\n22:50 - the Bardo at all you don't have to go through the limbo or the Purgatory period of the Soul's Journey after death Where You Are tortured and punished for your Bad Karma and rewarded for your\n23:02 - good karma your bad and Good Karma are sorted out in this very Life by the practice of Raj yog and cria yog so all glory be to Raj yog and Kaa yog this is the gift from the ancient Ries and the\n23:16 - land of India to the world at India no other gift to offer to the world the science of Raj yog and PR yog would itself suffice as a kingly\n23:32 - offering put gar yukar who himself is working to speed up the evolution of the souls in one of the Heavenly Heavenly spheres called H where all people from nikal samadi go to a\n23:48 - higher state of NB samadi so this is the relevance of the practice this is what the yogi does he works out his limbo his life after death journey of the Soul\n24:02 - he works out in this so when the soul passes out of the body when the body at the end of its life say 85 90 years is worn out this shining liberated pure Soul passes\n24:20 - out of the body it does go swiftly through all the other spheres you know of the physical sphere of then the the lower astral G sphere of pishach then the the emotional sphere of\n24:39 - P the astral sphere and then goes to The Shining sphere of D Lo immediately gets established there so this is the relevance of uh of uh the practice of\n24:55 - Raj yog and Kaa yog in today's life and not only is it relevant in today's life it is relevant in the life after because it deals not with your physical emotional and mental bodies nor your\n25:11 - intuitional uh uh Soul it deals with the liberation of the spirit that resides in your soul and therefore it is so essential for us to practice this now let me tell you something very\n25:26 - interesting whether soul is in karmic debt and it has to pass through the whole rigmar of the life after death or a soul has newly attained to\n25:39 - Liberation newly attained to Nal samadi it stands before a huge reality the reality is called the supreme justice of the cosmos the supreme\n25:55 - justice of the cosmos and its Cosmic form and of this the solar system in its solar system form as Yama Dharma he is known as Dharma and this being is the supreme\n26:09 - justice he meets out the supreme justice to All Souls who incarnate on this Earth whether they be normal Souls who are striving for Liberation and salvation or they be great uh siddhas or Ries yogis\n26:29 - or they may be avars and great Ries who come to help Mankind in their salvation before they come to this earth they pass through him and to the to the younger Souls He blesses but to the great ones\n26:44 - who come on Earth who are like Divine beings like the Christ and the Buddha and the Lord of lords vashish and and Atri and Bru Rishi the Great Mighty ones he gets up and bows down to them he pays\n26:56 - them honor washes their feet feet with the Lord yam the King of Kings known as the supreme justice washes the feet of rugu and vashish and all these great beings and all the Great Mighty Manus\n27:09 - who are there before him and respects them and gives them their seat of Honor in his kingdom in his Loca in his sphere that is known as yam but his Splendor is so much that\n27:22 - they say that in the Shanti parb bishma has spoken about it and it is said that Lord Rah after he finished his avaric or Divine uh uh Ministry his work on this Earth he also went to the Realms of yam\n27:39 - the great Justice and there yam received him with great honor and facilit facilitated him made him sit on his Golden Throne and then till he stayed there and returned\n27:51 - back to his own aboard the final beatitude of Lord Ram he turned to his own aboard so this person called yamadharma the supreme justice is the great Maharaja below him\n28:09 - is a person a king called chrup",

          "transcript": "00:21 - Today we live throbbing with life, today we\nlive throbbing with life, tomorrow we are gone, mere shadows in a waking dream, we leave\nthis world fore long. How strange this world of Maya is, how strange this world of illusion\nis, how gripping and how strong, in this cosmic motion picture, the right appears all wrong.\nThen dance we must to nature's tune of lust and fame and greed, until we realize no more\nthan sensual feed. Awake oh brothers of the\n01:13 - light, awaken to your own divinity and put\nillusion to flight. Race for you goal sublime. The way we can race for our goal sublime,\nis by practicing the science of Kriya Yoga. I have told you that 2012 is nearing. There\nare, people say that there are cataclysms and holocausts which will happen. Tectonic\nplates will shift. Well they already happened, the tsunami has\nalready happened. 300,000 people died. The\n01:50 - tsunami, the Pakistan earthquake left over\n100,000 people dead. The Katrina which happened in America left over 10 to 20,000 people dead,\nwhich is not reported, but these things are there and how many the ocean took away there\nis no count of. When the ocean goes and moves in such directions, if people are there, there\nis no chance. And people in America they are very stubborn, they didn't move out of their\nhouse. They tended to block their house with\n02:17 - blocks of wood, on a show I saw them hammering.\nEven while the hurricane is on, they were taking nails and hammering their\nhouses. It was bigger than expected and it blew the houses away. Some of them lasted.\nThen in the Middle East, there were some Earthquakes, in Turkey and all that. All these things,\nwhich if you count, the holocaust the cataclysms have already begun.\n02:40 - You have to practice Kriya Yoga, to override\nthe situation. Let me warn you again. Practice the ingestion of light which is Surya Yoga,\npractice Kriya Yoga. We can't control 2012, but if we ourselves are participating to bringing\nit on, how much effect do you think we can control? If we are told\nby high command to bring this on, to clear the negativity of the world, and then you\ntell us now control it, if it is already started\n03:08 - and I push a rock down a hill and it's already\ngoing down and then you tell me to stand in front of it, there's only partial speed I\ncan break. Okay? So this is an example I'm giving you of the masters, when they set foot\non it to clear certain blockages not of human beings alone, but all sentient and non-sentient\nbeings. You have to cooperate by ingesting more light in your body,\nwhere you'll be saved. They (the Great Masters)\n03:36 - have saved you before. In your Christian Bible,\nyou have heard of the story of Noah, he saved the whole Human Race two by two all plants\nand species. This was said in rather a childish way, but it was one of the stories of the\ngreat Manus called Vaivashvat, who you know to be Noah. Noah still exists. The Vaivashvat\nstill exists on this planet.

          "transcript": "The purpose of man’s sojourn on this earth, the most important purpose of his sojourn on this earth is to seek God.\n\nToday is the birthday of your guru, he teaches you that as you grow older your inner spark should become brighter. And every birthday your consciousness must expand, the next birthday more. So, the expansion of your divine consciousness, visa vi your aging process is a very essential factor of a balanced life so whatever vocation you have, whatever you do in life don’t forget to do your kriya yog. This is the message of the master. And if you do your kriya yog I will tell you, kriya yog is for God, it’s for Atma Pratiti it’s for spiritual realization and evolution. All that is ok, but let me tell you a material fact, from the grossest advantage of yog. The human body is carbon based, am I right? The human body is carbon based, so is the earth carbon based. Now the purpose of man’s life from the lowest the material end, from the spiritual end the only purpose of man’s life, the most important purpose is to seek god. But from the physical material point of view which you can grasp, the human body is carbon based, and therefore as you grow older the most important purpose of yours is to find a method whereby you can decarbonize your body and make it alkaline. Carbon and acidity in your body brings disease decay and death. So, the most powerful way of decarbonizing your body is the practice of kriya yog. Is a rejuve and detox method, it rejuvenates and detoxes you. As your breath comes up, you evolve consciousness, and all the cells in your body are oxygenated and start vibrating with new life. Old cells are repaired, degenerated cells are regenerated. So, it’s like a sanjeevani, it’s a rejuvenation.\n\nBurns your past evil karmas, and detoxifies the body, it decarbonizes the body, so you have to decarb your body. See carbon is black is like this, you understand? So, human beings live in ignorance, they cannot see the inner light because of the carbon then the guru shows the light. So, you have to see, that through the lamp glass of your body you can see the light of your soul. Can you see it all? Can you see your body is the lamp glass? Your body is the lamp and the flame is your soul. That’s what you should be, that’s what you are undying. Your body only dies, the flame is immortal. So, you look to the guru, to show you the light that he is, shown himself he will show you also. This is the work of the master. \n\nNow we will sit in silence.\n\nSo, we chant something on my birthday in honor of our ancestors. So, in India we have our lineages back right up to the gods. All of you are divine beings and you’re connected with your gotras, who are the divine rishis, which is very, very important. \n\nAll Chanting: Shri Ram Jai Ram Jai Jai Ram  \nAll chanting: Om Namah Shivay \n\n\nYogiraj Gurunath Siddhanath World Tour Schedule: http://www.siddhanath.org/events/yogiraj-events",

Buy and download this exact same video for inspiration to play on your computer or mobile device: http://store.payloadz.com/go?id=917412\r\n\r\n\"Today we live throbbing with life, today we live throbbing with life, tomorrow we are gone, mere shadows in a waking dream, we leave this world fore long. How strange this world of Maya is, how strange this world of illusion is, how gripping and how strong, in this cosmic motion picture, the right appears all wrong. Then dance we must to nature's tune of lust and fame and greed, until we realize no more than sensual feed. Awake oh brothers of the light, awaken to your own divinity and put illusion to flight. Race for you goal sublime.\"\r\n\r\nThe way we can race for our goal sublime is by practicing the science of Kriya Yoga. I have told you that 2012 is nearing. People say that there are cataclysms and holocaust which will happen. Tectonic plates will shift. Well they already happened, the tsunami has already happened. 300,000 people died. The tsunami, the Pakistan earthquake left over 100,000 people dead. The Katrina hurricane which happened in America left over 10 to 20,000 people dead which is not reported but these things are there and how many the ocean took away there is no count of. When the ocean goes and moves in such directions, if people are there, there is no chance. And people in America they are very stubborn, they didn't move out of their house. They tended to block their house with blocks of wood, on a show I saw them hammering. Even while the hurricane is on, they were taking nails and hammering houses. It was bigger than expected and it blew the houses away. Some of them lasted. Then in the Middle East, there were some Earthquakes, in Turkey, all these things, which if you count, the holocaust the cataclysms have already begun.\r\n\r\nYou have to practice Kriya Yoga, to override the situation. Let me warn you again. Practice the ingestion of light which is Surya Yoga, practice Kriya Yoga. We can't control 2012 but if we ourselves are participating to bringing it on, how much effect do you think we can control? If we are told by high command to bring this on to clear the negativity of the world, and then you tell us now control it, if it is already started and I push a rock down a hill and it's already going down and then you tell me to stand in front of it, there's only partial speed I can break. Okay? So this is an example I'm giving you of the masters, when they set foot on it to clear certain blockages not of human beings alone, but all sentient and non-sentient beings. You have to cooperate by ingesting more light in your body, where you'll be saved. They (the Great Masters) have saved you before. In your Christian Bible, you have heard of the story of Noah, he saved the whole Human Race two by two all plants and species. This was said in rather a childish way, but it was one of the stories of the great Manus called Vaivashvat, who you know to be Noah. Noah still exists. The Vaivashvat Manu still exists on this planet. He still exists.\r\n\r\n\"You are not this house of flesh and bone...\", \"He about whom we know nothing\",\"Make Me Thy Truth, Make Me Thy Love, Eternal Lord of Light\"\r\n\r\nCopyright © Hamsa Yoga Sangh®.

          "transcript": "00:08 - [Filmed in Los Angeles, California on 08.10.2010\n- Learn Kriya Yoga from a Living Master: Yogiraj Siddhanath] [Opening Music Introduction] This\nis an open eye experiment, an open eye. Do not close your eyes, keep your eyes open.\nIf your eyes burn, with the wave of the hand and rose water, I shall take away the burning\nof your eyes but keep looking at me for I am going to give you the experience to be\nvery simple about it, I am not going to chew\n00:46 - words, I am going to give you my soul consciousness\nof a thoughtless awareness, my enlightened consciousness of a thoughtless awareness.\nAye? [Response] Aye. This will be done by you first becoming like a child of five. You\nknow how you were when you were five? Transport yourself back to that carefree age. Then drop\nall inhibition and resistance. Drop all armor and make yourself available to me. Form a\ngolden gate bridge between your heart and\n01:22 - my heart. Open your eyes and don't close them.\nForm a golden gate bridge between your heart and my heart, open your eyes. With this technique,\nwe will realize that at the level of consciousness, humanity is one. That is one thing. Secondly,\nwe will realize, during this process, your aging... you get an anti-aging effect. The\ndecaying process stops in that moment of time. This is the ultimate spa because if your mind\ndoesn't work, if your thoughts don't work\n01:51 - and molecules are not there, there's no disease,\ndecay and death. If nothing moves there is no change. Only movement has change but nothing\ncan have no change. Because change is only of something, change cannot be of nothing.\nNothing cannot change. Only something can change. Aye? [Response] Aye. Different language\nbut it's true. So I am giving you nothing but it is the source of everything - it is\nsoul consciousness. So you get to taste my\n02:20 - soul consciousness. When I give you soul consciousness,\nreceive it with love and reverence. Look at me form the golden gate bridge, drop the mind\nopen the heart, be in attunement. As I wave my hand, you'll go into the silence. Look\nat me and nowhere else. Be in silence. When I wave my hand, thoughts will disappear and\nyou will enter a profound peace and bliss according to your harmony with me. Ready?\n[Gurunath starts Shivapat] Thoughts are still.\n03:07 - The mind's lake is crystal. [Shivapat] Keep\nlooking at me. The aura you will see, the changing faces, but be still with me. Tune\ninto my consciousness and your mind will disappear. [The Master's Shivapat continues] If your\neyes are burning, keep them open. I will remove the burning sensation. Now keep your eyes\nopen. Be with me. Focus on soul consciousness. Removing the burning sensation of the eyes\n[Gurunath waves his hand across] Okay. Burning\n05:14 - sensation gone, Aye? [Response] Aye. Keep\nlooking. When you see the aura of light, you can see the concentric circles of colors violet,\nindigo, blue, green, orange, red each according to the degree of clairvoyance. The rainbow\nbody, as they say, around the master. Cottony white gold, violet, indigo, blue, green two\ncolors, five colors, depending on what you see you will see. That's your clairaudience\nfor today. The faces will be past life associations.\n05:60 - [Shivapat] The spirit of God has infused this\nhouse. The more you relax, the more you will see. Keep calmly looking. Be in the still\nmind. The decay and the aging of the body cells has been arrested. The more you relax\nthe stiller you will be in my soul consciousness. Come share my samadhi. You are sharing my\nsamadhi. [Copyright Hamsa Yoga Sangh. All rights reserved]",

Buy and download this exact same video for inspiration to play on your computer or mobile device: http://store.payloadz.com/go?id=935951\n\nHYS Vintage Video Series - Filmed in Los Angeles, California on 08.10.2010 - Learn Kriya Yoga from a Living Master: Yogiraj SatGurunath Siddhanath http://www.hamsa-yoga.org/kriya-yoga \n\nThis is an open eye experiment, an open eye. Do not close your eyes, keep your eyes open. If your eyes burn, with the wave of the hand and rose water, I shall take away the burning of your eyes but keep looking at me for I am going to give you the experience to be very simple about it, I am not going to chew words, I am going to give you my soul consciousness of a thoughtless awareness, my enlightened consciousness of a thoughtless awareness. Aye? [Response] Aye. This will be done by you first by becoming like a child of five. You know how you were when you were five? Transport yourself back to that carefree age. Then drop all inhibition and resistance. Drop all armor and make yourself available to me. Form a gold gate bridge between your heart and my heart. Open your eyes and don't close them. Form a golden gate bridge between your heart and my heart, open your eyes. With this technique, we will realize that at the level of consciousness, humanity is one. That is one thing. Secondly, we will realize, during this process, your aging... you get an anti-aging effect. The decaying process stops in that moment of time. This is the ultimate spa because if your mind doesn't work, if your thoughts don't work and molecules are not there, there's no disease, decay and death. If nothing moves there is no change. Only movement has change but nothing can have no change. Because change is only of something, change cannot be of nothing. Nothing cannot change. Only something can change. Aye? [Response] Aye. Different language but it's true. So I am giving you nothing but it is the source of everything - it is soul consciousness. So you get to taste my soul consciousness. When I give you soul consciousness, receive it with love and reverence. Look at me form the golden gate bridge, drop the mind open the heart, be in attunement. As I wave my hand, you'll go into the silence. Look at me and nowhere else. Be in silence. When I wave my hand, thoughts will disappear and you will enter a profound peace and bliss according to your harmony with me. Ready? [Gurunath starts Shivapat] thoughts are still. The mind's lake is crystal. [Shivapat Gaze] Keep looking at me. The aura you will see. The changing faces, but be still with me. Tune into my consciousness and your mind will disappear. [The Master's Shivapat gaze continues] If your eyes are burning, keep them open, I will remove the burning sensation. Now keep your eyes open. Be with me. Focus on soul consciousness. Removing the burning sensation of the eyes [Gurunath waves his hand across] Okay, burning sensation gone, Aye? [Response] Aye. Keep looking. When you see the aura of light, you can see the concentric circles of colors violet, indigo, blue, green, orange, red each according to the degree of clairvoyance. The rainbow body, as they say, around the master. Cottony white gold, violet, indigo, blue, green two colors, five colors, depending on what you see you will see. That's your clairaudience for today. The faces will be past life associations. [Shivapat Gaze] The spirit of God has infused this house. The more you relax, the more you will see. Keep calmly looking. Be in the still mind. The decay and the aging of the body cells has been arrested. The more you relax the stiller you will be in my soul consciousness. Come share my samadhi. You are sharing my samadhi.\n\nCopyright © Hamsa Yoga Sangh®. All rights reserved",

          "transcript": "00:05 - [Filmed Northwest Retreat Portland, Oregon\nSeptember 2010] [Signup for a 2011 retreat with Yogiraj Siddhanath] Just lead the good\nlife, breathe God. Breathe Him in and breathe Him out and saturate yourself with God so\nmuch that there is no room for anybody but God. Never mind what other people say, never\nmind what philosophers talk about, unless you fall in love with your breath and get\nmad after God, there is little that can be\n01:04 - achieved. And all the other achievements come\nto naught. When Alexander (the Great) conquered large portions of the world, his Guru who\nwas from India, his Master, came to Alexander and told him, that the Guru's was Kalinath,\nmispronounced Kalyanos, Kalinath of the Nath tradition, to which I belong. He told him,\nAlexander what have you lost and what have you gained? Nothing was yours so that you\ncould have gained it. The only things that\n01:39 - you must have control of is life and death,\nthat is in the hands of God. So when you die you come with nothing and you go with nothing.\nYou have to teach this lesson to the world. So when you die and they bury you, tell them\nto keep your hands out of the grave empty. Empty I came and empty I did depart, except\nfor the spirit that I am taking with me. So he (Alexander) took a great spirit with him.\nHe was not only a great conqueror and a warrior,\n02:10 - but he was a great yogi and a great spiritual\nsoul. And you will hear the sound of Alexander, and his preachings and teachings through various\nclimes and times and people and climates. And so was the great emperor, Genghis Khan,\nthe king of kings, the emperor of emperors, these mighty beings. That when they focused\non the sun, or whoever they thought of to be God, they had the capacity to lose themselves,\nso intense was their concentration. That Khan,\n02:49 - was the sun incarnate himself. \nSuch are the stories of these great people, that they not only conquered the world but\nthey had conquered a lot within themselves too so as to be able to be absorbed in God,\nso as to be able to be absorbed in the Supreme Being. And all of you have this potential\nof Alexander and the emperor of emperors, Genghis Khan. And all these great warriors\nand all these great saints like Jesus, like\n03:31 - Buddha, the Christ, Apollonius of Tyana, all\nthese great people, Francis of Assisi, Anandamayi Ma. She was the avatar of the century and\nshe showed us this spirituality is not the monopoly of men, that women can avail of this\nstate even as much as men can. Their pathways may be different because they choose to be\ndifferent. They choose the way of the heart. If they choose the way of the spiritual power\nof the soul, then they shall go that way,\n04:10 - if they choose the way of devotion, they shall\ngo that way. So unto all of us He is here, He is speaking to me, He is speaking to you\nthis moment. And it is the one who is hearing him that is God also. The one who is speaking\nis God, the one who is hearing is God also. So we must be drunk with Him. Inhale God,\nexhale God, live God, love God, eat God, live God, die God, resurrect God and be constantly\nwith God for He is so essential to our being\n04:51 - and existence. The other day, an article came\nfrom Stephen Hawking saying that existence does not need God for its proof, naturally\nnot, because God is just a word. Call it what you may. Existence is existence, God is existence\nso why should existence need existence to prove itself? But existence, God, is not dependent\non existence, like the ocean is not dependent on the wave. Existence comes into being through\nthe white hole and the big bang and disappears\n05:42 - through the supermassive black hole. But in\nall its 311 Trillion years of the creation, preservation and destruction of the universe,\nGod is there. And after the universe disappears, God is still there. After the universe appears,\nHe is still there. He needs no credit for what He is doing for there is nothing else\nbut Him. There is nothing else but God. You are God, I am God, He is God, this is God,\nthat is God, everything is Him. There is nothing\n06:16 - that is not Him. [Copyright й Hamsa Yoga\nSanghо. All rights reserved]",

          "transcript": "00:09 - [Experience The Master's Empowerment] [Introductory\nMusic by Shivraj] [Filmed during the Sept 2010 Mt Madonna Retreat, Santa Cruz, CA] Question,\nWhat is the actual process of empowerment, did they experience it tonight. Can you help\nto clarify this question? [Gurunath] You see you all experienced empowerment tonight but\nI can make you experience more and more as we go along the days more specifically. I\nam just requesting you to be more receptive\n00:46 - in the sense that you should firstly be, have\nthe heart of a child. Joyous, light and receptive. Not a querying or intellectual mind. You know\nif you have the intellectual mind, the heal or cure doesn't take place, as you've seen\nthrough examples. So when you have this receptive mind, then I can work with you. Like I may\ncome and work with you tonight too in your dreams which I can easily do, I have a lot\nof adjustments to make and seeing the way\n01:19 - you are all sitting, ahh, I surely have a\nlot of work to do tonight with your spine. And thank God, the beds are pretty stiff,\nthat saved me a lot of work, but I have to work, my work is a ceaseless work, it's non-stop\nand non-rest, it's night and day. 24x7. And when I empower you some of you feel it more,\na lightness of body, a freshness, a joyousness of heart, you forget your tensions, you leave\nyour stresses behind. When you get all these\n01:54 - feelings, I don't take the credit for all\nthis, but let me tell you since I am connected with you since past lives, I have to take\nthis responsibility. And definitely a major portion of me is seeping through your heart\nand mind. A major portion of me of me is seeping through your heart and mind but even though\nI am doing that, it is up to you, to allow me to do it. Are you allowing me to heal you,\nare you allowing yourself to be healed? You\n02:31 - must relax and allow yourself to be healed.\nYou must relax and allow yourself to be healed. Now that your children are being looked after\nby people at home, or by baby watchers, or baby sitters, whatever you call them, it's\ntime for you to relax and take the greatest gift on earth, you have the greatest gift\non earth, but you cannot tap the source. The fountain of youth lies within you, and yet\nyou are hungry and starving and suffering\n03:01 - and quarreling, for what? Because you don't\nlook within, your mind is always engaged, you're always instructing and planning and\nif you are always instructing and planning and calculating in life, you're planning this,\nyou're planning that, you started that, so when you're planning an instruction, spending\nyou life like that, so when are you going to live your life? Live it now. This is it.\nand therefore if you live your life now and\n03:36 - be, this is the moment, I'm going to receive\nevery word of Gurunath. I have faith the next word he speaks my pain will go away, I promise\nyou it will go away, you see. Gurunath you spoke and my pain went away only 75%. Why?\nDear sir, the 25 percent was the obstruction of your subconscious mind. I tell you, the\nmind which is not disciplined and which is an I am-ness and an egotistic mind, is the\nreal satan. That is satan. So therefore transmission,\n04:20 - the Master is like a pulsar star, he's pulsating\nall the time. You can see many of you, none of you are beginners here. You are advanced\npeople. You are coming for an advanced course. And to a great degree you've developed clairaudience,\nclairvoyance, premonition, intuition. All of you have it to various degrees, and if\nyou see the aura of the Master, You'll be able to see it very clearly like a, of course\nit's septenary, 7 colored aura, it's the rainbow\n04:57 - colored man, the master's always that, but\nyou see the white cottony gold and that is the energy transmissions and vibrations which\nseeps into every cell of you body, which goes to every wounded portion, which goes to every\nhurt portion, and heals it. But you must allow yourself to be healed. You're not allowing\nyourself to be healed because you're listening to me intellectually. Don't listen to me intellectually,\njust relax, lean back, and just feel me out.\n05:30 - If you miss the words it does not matter.\nHear my words. Hear my words. Feel the flavor. See the flower. Not the intellect. Then the\nhealing will take place. So the transmission is definitely happening spontaneously without\nany effort of mine. You will magnetically attract it to that portion of your body or\nsuffering emotion, or your mental trauma, or stress and I promise you the sky is the\nlimit. For a receptive person, the sky is\n06:06 - the limit. You can do it. There have been\npeople here, the lady just gave us an example, totally comparatively new, they did it and\nit will happen because the good Lord does it. The Master does it. So the transmission\nis the transmission, it's the velocity which the pranic energy or the kundalini energy\ncalled shaktipat travels from the master to the disciple. [Pause] So the then when this\ntravels during their kriya, during their process\n06:52 - of meditation, it helps them and empowers\nthem to practice Kriya Yoga. Yes.",

          "transcript": "00:07 - you said PR yoga is been practiced by the gods what is the difference between Angels ascended masters and gods are they practicing PR yoga there are all different states of\n00:19 - hierarchy after K yog there are other yogas some people have transcended that practice I would not be able to say whether all people are practicing it or not but I\n00:34 - know that many of them are practicing it and it is a central theme for the evolution of of a special type of humanity as also I can say you're the special type of humanity now why you a\n00:46 - special type of humanity because you have three noses and five eyes no it's because you're noral but your speciality lies in the fact that you're practicing PR yog that's why you the\n00:57 - special type of humanity it's not that God has to choose someone or not you have made yourself choosen by your own the virtue of your own\n01:09 - practice more you practice God more you you are God to the extent you know God you are God to the extent you know God then if you practice morea you will know become more and more of God and\n01:28 - less and less of man meaning you will become more and more of the Divine Consciousness and less and less of the corruptable body your Consciousness will be more\n01:39 - aware of itself as Divine awareness than it will be aware of itself as the corruptible body of which which which you know decays and dies so by the practice of your\n01:53 - Consciousness by the practice of K yog your Consciousness is shifted from man The Brute to the man to man the god it expands that's why K yog is called the lightning part it travels\n02:07 - in the spine does one year of travel the soul is the sun of this of the nine chakras the planets the soul is the sun of the nin planets or the E planets of the chakras and as it travels\n02:23 - around the spine the sun travels around the Zodiac it completes in 365 days one year you complete in 44 seconds one year around the zodiac signs around the planets which are located in your sh\n02:37 - chakras you complete one year of natural spiritual unfoldment in 44 seconds that's why this is the authentic and original pra yog is given [Music]\n02:53 - by the authentic PR yog in my book pra yog I'm dealing with all these different types of yoges the K yoges which are given they have their purpose but and they're all\n03:05 - connected but some one is the main stream the main line and other the other yogas are sort of bations or tributaries in one of your practices uh where we focus on the chakras um the so manipura\n03:21 - chakra has the yellow golden color and in the other practice um it has a green color what is the difference difference is this that the Orthodox original practi is man is made of light light has\n03:36 - a spectrum violet indigo blue green green yellow orange red now this is the Orthodox method of the light flowing in man how it spreads out as a spectrum and from light man is\n03:53 - created or at least that is his Source there are many things between the Spectrum and the light in the physical body but if you take it down in in relative sequence it forms the physical\n04:04 - body it's causal inal emotional you know then passional then ponic physical and then teral material that's the human body but now when I'm dealing\n04:19 - with the chakras they are the five pranas lodged in the astral body the pric body and in those five Pras which are are between the highest and physical body is an astral sphere the astral\n04:33 - chakras donating the color of The Prana is that the base root is is upon has a Scarlet red color then there's the vanan in the next Center then in the NAB Center is the\n04:47 - digestive Green Lotus of of saman San BR is green digestive then there's the pran pr pranic pran which is golden and then so this is the color of the pranas that is the color of the\n05:03 - causal bodies when when produced by Spectrum so this is the colors of the Quran and then here is again the rose color the blue color metabolic so this is the metabolic a\n05:16 - blue color of PR so that we are practicing healing with these colors therefore the pric colors are not to be mixed up with the colors of the spectrum can\n05:28 - reside wherever you take everything is karma the breeze blowing on your face some bitable Karma the bleeping of the eyelashes s Ripple in the aash gods of\n05:48 - the whole universe you blink like a smoke there's a quiver so we are floating in the soup of Karma and everything is karma what to talk about it if I talk from now today death also\n06:01 - you cannot finish it because everything in relativity is connected with Sarma it forms an action and reaction relativity means K every action has an equal and opposite\n06:16 - reaction that is karma it is known as the law of Justice the law of compensation it keeps human beings in Balance balance okay to the truth is\n06:28 - truth because the liar gets his own so do such actions reactions you don't know so karma is very very very important your individual present explains your individual past each one\n06:43 - is allotted his exact and proper task",

          "transcript": "00:08 - so during the break uh quite these people were asking the question of what is the actual process of empowerment and did they experience it tonight you helped to clarify this question see\n00:22 - you all experienced empowerment tonight but I I can make you experience it as we go along the days more and more specifically\n00:35 - I'm just requesting you to be more receptive in the sense that you should firstly be have the heart of a child joyous light and receptive\n00:48 - not a queering or an intellectual mind you know if you have the intellectual mind the Healer cure doesn't take place as you've seen through examples so when you have this receptive mind\n01:00 - then I can work with you like I may come and work with you tonight too in your dreams which are I can easily do I've got a lot of adjustments to make and seeing the\n01:12 - way you all are sitting uh I surely have I have a lot of work to do tonight with your spine and thank God that the beds are pretty stiff so that saved me a lot of work but\n01:25 - I have to work because my work is a ceaseless work it's Non-Stop and non-rest night and day it's a 24 7. and when I Empower you some of you feel it more you feel a likeness\n01:39 - of body a freshness a joyousness and heart you forget your tensions you leave your stresses behind when you get all these feelings I don't take the credit for all this but let me tell you since\n01:51 - I'm connected with you since past lives I have to take this responsibility and definitely a major portion of me is seeping through your heart and mind a major portion of\n02:04 - me is seeping through your heart and mind but even though I am doing that it is up to you to allow me to do it are you allowing me to heal you are you allowing yourself to\n02:22 - be healed you must relax and allow yourself to be healed you must relax and allow yourself to be healed now that your children are being looked after by people at home or by baby Watchers or\n02:38 - babysitters whatever you call them this time for you to relax and take the greatest gift on Earth you have the greatest gift on Earth but you cannot tap your sauce the Fountain of Youth\n02:50 - lies within you and yet you are hungry and starving and suffering and quarreling for what because you don't look Within your mind is always engaged you're\n03:06 - always instructing and planning and if you are instructing and planning and calculating in life you're planning this you're planning that you started so when you're planning an instruction you\n03:19 - spend your life with that and when are you going to live your life live it now this is it and therefore if you live your life now and just be this is the moment I'm going\n03:30 - to receive every word of gurunath I have faith the next word he speaks my pain will go away I promise you it will go away you see\n03:40 - you spoke and my pain went away only 75 why Dear Sir the 25 percent was the obstruction of your subconscious mind I tell you the mind\n03:54 - which is indisciplined and which is which is an i amness an egotistic mind is the real Satan that is Satan so therefore transmission\n04:13 - the Masters like a pulsar star he's pulsating all the time you can see many of you none of you are beginners here you are Advanced people you're coming in\n04:28 - for an advanced course and definitely you've developed to a great degree clairaudience clairvoyance premonition intuition all of you have it\n04:41 - to various degrees and if you see the order of the master you'll be able to see it very clearly like the of course it's it's certainly seven colored Aura it's the rainbow colored man the master\n04:51 - is always that but you see firstly the white Courtney gold and that is the energy transmission of vibrations which seeps into every cell of your body which goes to every wounded portion which goes\n05:03 - to every hurt portion and heals it but you must allow yourself to be healed you are not allowing yourself to be healed because you are listening to me intellectually don't listen to me\n05:16 - intellectually just relax lean back and just feel me out if you miss the words it doesn't matter hear my words hear my words\n05:28 - feel the flavor see the flower not the intellect then the healing will take place so the transmission is definitely happening\n05:42 - spontaneously without any effort or mine you will magnet magnetically Attract it to that portion of your body or your suffering emotion or your mental trauma or stress and I promise you the sky is\n05:56 - the limit for receptive person the sky is the limit you can do it there have been people here the lady just gave us an example totally comparatively new they did it and it\n06:09 - will happen because the good Lord does it the master does it so the transmission is the transmission it's the velocity with which The Chronic energy or the Kundalini energy called\n06:25 - shaktipath travels from the the master to the disciple so the then when this travels during their Korea during their their process of meditation it helps them and empowers\n06:47 - them to practice kriya yogis",

          "transcript": "00:07 - so what I was saying is there is no absolute truth in this world of Relativity so I was talking about the absolute truth that only the Supreme reality is\n00:23 - absolute truth in relativity there is no absolute truth but then you will ask gun how about PR y we doing the lightning part to God and Baba is given PR y yes\n00:38 - because these are partial truths which make up the whole jiga puzzle as you evolve and you pass around you become more and more of the absolute truth and less and less of the relative truth as\n00:49 - you expand your your Consciousness to merge into the Divine Consciousness until you become by the time you become absolute truth you yourself are in Divine Consciousness until when\n01:04 - you expand your absolute truth of Consciousness becomes one with absolute of Consciousness you see and then there's the state that those who know it tell it not and those who tell it know\n01:18 - it not all is what is and is not so that is not a question of intellectual discussion the absolute truth is not a question of\n01:29 - speculation or intellect discussion or mathematization of math because of the floating or the recurring\n01:41 - number or the floating point the decimal point therefore when K yog is even given or even math is given they are helpful because not being the absolute truth\n01:54 - they are partial truths which lead you to God those truths that don't lead you to God those truths that don't lead you to\n02:11 - God those truths that don't lead you to God dissipate in the elements dust to dust water to water Earth to Earth water to water fire to fire air to air whatever those truths\n02:25 - are and H they don't have much relevance in seeking the absolute truth they have temporary elements in seeking the element on which you focus on focus on Earth you realize Earth focus on\n02:40 - water you realize water focus on fire you realize fire so also with the exact Sciences they are to be respected there are two aspects of the exact Sciences one is towards\n02:51 - tending towards material interests and material things of Relativity and the world the other part of science like K yog and other techniques of meditation and yog and prayer and devotion are\n03:03 - focused towards the absolute reality you have to choose what you want and science as a whole is respected it has its purpose in\n03:17 - relativity special science is even more respected for yogis that science which leads you towards the absolute reality the absolute truth and therefore these are the two\n03:31 - bations nothing is bad nothing is good everything is as is but we with our inment our SAT\n03:46 - Bud our discrimination outwardly then discernment in the astral body and incern of our soul have to realize which pathway we would like to take right so there is a lot of help people had\n04:03 - discovered thousands of years you know thousands of years before Newton think called The Law of Karma and that law preceded before the ancient Indian yogis and the thousands\n04:18 - of years Discovery it still existed you see action and reaction gravitation all existed and it is mentioned in the ancient Vas it is mentioned in the\n04:32 - ancient shic techniques you know that the speed of light was mentioned it was just they they chose to ignore it the West when they came up the\n04:45 - new babies of the West they came up to Egypt and stopped that was one of their forefathers and they came to the other forefathers and they said this is Greek and they stopped they didn't know that\n04:55 - the mother of the Greek language is ssit and they failed hopelessly to explore and discover India those projects sponsored by the government but individual Souls from\n05:07 - America Switzerland Germany the individual Souls they made the foray and they are the true Pioneers because they were not self opiniated they had a pure and selfless heart and\n05:19 - they were eager to learn the moment they sat down and said Master teach me they progressed same with the Indian people there was so self arrogant and opiniated\n05:32 - we don't need to learn anything from the West is wrong the moment they they went to the west and said Master teacher they learned the exact Sciences they learned development they learned certain very\n05:44 - good things from the West you may say that we had it before I agree but then now who has it they have it Communications and organized system a good mindset to progress clinically Upon\n05:58 - A Certain path I'm not saying the Su and this thing were not there before Medical Science then Hypocrites came and did something he was influenced by the Greek me and the surgery of the soci and the\n06:12 - of the the other not the they were all influencing and now mod science was influenced by prop and they now modern science has their own progress so they're all complimentary to\n06:26 - one another all complimentary to one another so nothing this actually is not a subject of of discussion or contradiction on\n06:38 -

          "transcript": "00:05 - we have cycles of time okay now I have always believed that the yugas SAT yug daper yug and Tra yug you know kug dwapar yug tra yug and sat yug these\n00:24 - are the four yugas the cycles of time where human Souls pass through and they evolve to subtler Innovations to subtler ideologies to more spiritual you know\n00:41 - Behavior the yugar are lengthened and shortened by the degree of concentration of that individual soul so there is a cyclic\n00:54 - yoga which is of humanity and there's an individual yugas which you go through very fast now they say when you're in the presence of a master you're in the golden age when\n01:08 - you're before the sguru you're always in the Golden Age you see his Golden Aura you see the purple star of the East you are enveloped in the white golden light as only few people saw that all of us\n01:19 - were in that enveloped what does that mean you are all in the Golden Age you're in a different dimension with the master you're not in a material dimension you're in a spiritual\n01:31 - Dimension so they were saying that some people said that oh we have to adjust these yogas according to Mechanical mathematics which we respect my experience of this is totally\n01:43 - different the human evolution is fulfilled let us say if you take it materially the speed of light is 300,000 km/s 300,000 kilm right per\n01:58 - second the master have fulfilled this awful condition that they have broken the space time continuum forah mahasaya said of Baba today I have seen the Conqueror of death\n02:14 - today I have seen the Lord of death for him no time nor space exists and he is the holder of the keys of heaven and\n02:27 - hell so now the thing is like this that we have many degrees of initiation say the first degree is a d second degree is a parak okay the hamsa saak third degree\n02:43 - is the hamsa fourth degree is the paramhamsa fifth is the sidha after the fourth degree human evolution is complete the fifth degree is superhuman Evolution so as we pass along the yogas\n03:01 - we have in our Consciousness when we do the Kaa at the first stage we travel at say the 20% the speed of light\n03:17 - okay that is the stage of the D the initiate he who has entered the stream he who has entered the current of light travels at 20% the speed of light not his body\n03:31 - his spiritual consciousness because it's still encumbered by astral body or the celestial bodies then when he becomes a\n03:46 - hamsa or a paraka his body travels at 40% the speed of light because in his cria his con concentration\n04:04 - increases then as he evolves through his own personal yoga he goes to the state of the hamsa where he's traveling at 60% the speed of light\n04:19 - approximately 160,000 miles per second he's traveling in his own spine it's called the lightning path remember then as he evolves from the\n04:36 - stage of the hamsa he goes to the stage of the paramhamsa which is the final there he travels at the per speed of 80% of the speed of light is able to break the crown chakra and occasionally go to\n04:49 - 100% 80% 100% so when he goes to 100% he goes to the final samadi at the speed of light he has broken the light barrier and and he is infinite but it's temporary then when at the fifth stage\n05:05 - he becomes a sidha he travels at 100% the speed of light he has entered sat yog he is not Shackled by his karma he is everywhere and nowhere at the same time his mass is infinite the\n05:17 - sidha beyond the sidha three states which are the aut the sixth degree the seventh degree is the avar they are Way Beyond the speed of light and we do not know the nature of their work exactly\n05:30 - not the complete nature and then the Avatar the sth degree is beyond the speed of light back to the future he comes down again he comes it was a downward\n05:42 - crossing a through a through AA means descent so when the AAR descends he cannot descend in all that power he has to lessen his power to accommodate himself to The Limited\n05:58 - understanding of human beings right and when he gets there then he stretches his hand across to souls stuck in the mire the delusion illusion and error of materialism and he plucks them out of\n06:12 - their plight and brings them home through the boat through the Prav the first boat the light and breath of sound so he is called the Great\n06:26 - Redeemer the avar is the Redeemer the emancipator but Shiva or Baba they are the they are the dissolver Redeemer they destroy the Destroyer\n06:41 - Redeemer they destroy the evil and redeem the the righteous soul and destroy the disease Decay and death in human beings and redeem his soul so at 100% the speed of light it is\n06:55 - a sidha the perfected being and in the Satya yog you will all be 100 % speed of light and you will all be in the SAT yog 500 years hence that's that is the special sat so\n07:10 - there are yugas within yugas Cycles within Cycles from the minutest second to the vastest cosmic cycle have you understood what I'm\n07:24 - saying this talks about individual evolution in the in the the moving moving of the world disciple into sat yog so when the world disciple moves at that speed that means the yugas will\n07:36 -

          "title": "The Master Dies To The Disciple - Part 1 of 3",
          "transcript": "00:16 - The master dies to the disciple to the extent\nof the degree of his concentration on the master. The disciple is sitting and focused on a picture\nof his guru, of the master. Okay? Let&#39;s say this is the master here.\n00:57 - Let&#39;s say I&#39;m a person called Yogiraj Gurunath. Okay? For all\npractical purposes. This is the master. There&#39;s the disciple.\n01:04 - The disciple is focusing on the master. The master is sitting before you, this is\none place. And he is also part of the inner most essence\nof your true self. He&#39;s in two places, in your heart and here. So he is subjectively in your heart and objectively\nhere.\n01:26 - Is that clear? Now you begin to concentrate on the master. As you concentrate you will find your thoughts\nare running away. But then you bring it back to his face, his\nhair, his beard. And you are beginning to say, oh, beloved\nMaster I am so happy to have you.\n01:49 - Because when I see your face, I forget all\nmy outward distractions, all my going shopping, even though it&#39;s Christmas time, because you\nlook like Santa Claus. So I have nowhere else to go. [Laughter] I mean, I&#39;m just giving you a sample\nprayer. When you say this, you can say [Laughter].\n02:03 - Oh dear Santa, you look so saintly, like Saint\nNicolas, therefore my mind is, whatever the prayer you know, keep praying. Now as you keep praying, the Master creates\na magnetism on his face and in your heart and you get connected to his face. Please keep looking at me, it&#39;s going to happen\nwhen I talk.\n02:35 - This is a dynamic process of factual happening\nwhich I am taking you through. It&#39;s a dynamic progression. It&#39;s an actual happening. Experiential. Then the disciple keeps looking.\n02:43 - And the atoms of the disciple&#39;s eyes and \nthe master&#39;s atoms get connected into one form. And the gaze of the disciple steadies on the\nMaster. His mind stops running. So from a state of concentration, the master\nwith his magnetism.\n03:10 - The Master, in Indian Language, is called. He goes by the name of &quot;spiritual atrraction&quot;. The Master in Indian language is called Guru. The Guru word comes from &quot;Gurutva&quot;. &quot;Gurutvakarshan&quot; which is magnetic attraction.\n03:38 - So as the Master does his gravitational effect. It is gravitation. Gurutva means gravitational attraction. Gurutva means gravity. Gurutva.\n03:54 - So the Guru is one who has gravity to bring\nout the hidden knowledge of the disciple and enlighten him. This is my description. He cracks the code of Maya and takes you to\nBrahma. That is the Guru.\n04:13 - He who is the gravity, gravitational well. So as you keep, the Guru starts dissolving,\nhe starts dying into the concentration of the disciple which now turns into a meditation. And then there&#39;s no distraction of thought. The disciple keeps looking at the Master and\nSatguru.\n04:37 - The Satguru helps the Master in a uniform,\ndouble way, by creating an attraction in the heart of the\ndisciple. That is one of the places where he is. The disciple keeps looking with interest at\nthe Guru&#39;s face and steadies his mind. The leaking wounds of distracted thoughts\nhave disappeared and the mind is solid and\n04:50 - now in a state of meditation. His thoughts are not\nwaivering anywhere. And the Guru is gradually dying into the disciple\nby his gravity and merging into the disciple. The disciple&#39;s atoms are one with the atoms\nof the Guru and he has become an integral part of the disciple&#39;s meditation.\n05:21 - From concentration the disciple has gone\nto a deeper layer of meditation. Formerly, in concentration, the Guru was an\nintegral part of him but now he and the Guru are one. The whole of the Guru and the disciple have\nbecome one in meditation. As the disciple keeps looking at the Guru,\nthe Guru further dies into the disciple&#39;s\n05:42 - awareness and makes the disciple enter from\nthe atomic to the sub-atomic layer. The Guru loses form. The eyes of the disciple are fixed on the\nGuru and the disciple can see the aura around the Guru. The aura is expanding more and more.\n06:22 - It&#39;s a white cottony gold with flashes of\nviolet, purple, rose and indigo. Rose colored, golden colored. And the disciple keeps looking. His eyes are watering not blinking. The Guru&#39;s form is disappearing.\n06:28 - He goes to the formless state. That means the disciple and the Master have\nentered from the atomic structure to the sub-atomic structure of the Guru&#39;s form. Where they see not his form so clearly but\nthey feel the joy. They see his attributes.\n06:45 - So I do not see the Guru&#39;s face, his beard\nso clearly but but I &#39;m now beginning to experience his sub-atomic energy of ananda, so this is\nfrom the third stage, second stage of meditation he goes deeper into state of ecstacy, first\nstage which is a sub-atomic stage of the Guru&#39;s energy of peace. And his mind is fixed upon his Guru.\n07:09 - The Guru has died from the form and become\na formless ananda of the heart of the disciple.. This is how the Guru gradually dissolves himself\nand dies to the disciple, killing the ego of the disciple in the process. Next stage. The disciple now experiences only the energy\nof the Guru and he has now entered the sub-atomic\n07:58 - stage. From an integral part, the disciple becomes\nthe whole of the Guru. From a part of his energy of joy of ananda,\nnow the disciple concentrates deeper and goes into an ecstacy of expanded consciousness\nwhere he realises himself as he and the joy of the Guru in all completeness.\n08:20 - First he realised the attribute of joy partially,\nnow he goes deeper to realise it completely. And at this stage, which is the state of savikalpa\nsamadhi, Crack, patack, the ego has split. He has cracked the code. His ego has dissolved. And he is now floating in a vast sea of satchidananda.",

how many can feel the pranic impact the transmission resonance so that means how many believe that even if I say oh la dee da da da doo dee dee dum da da da da da that still will have the transmission\n00:42 - raise your hands so in actuality the teacher you will be the people teaching I will be the one talking nonsense and transforming you can only teach you cannot transform I will talk nonsense\n00:55 - that's my prerogative to talk nonsense nonsense is the sixth sense beyond the five senses the sixth sense is nonsense it makes no sense to the physical five senses but it's beyond it's beyond the\n01:11 - normal logical digital brain so it's nonsense okay so you don't have to grasp what I am talking about you have to grasp the transmission and how it's bringing a change how this\n01:27 - madman is slowly making you into a man it was just like this this person in the prison they said come on now you're perfectly cured you know you're out of the lunatic asylum he said no no let me\n01:47 - be here don't tell anyone that I'm okay there's a bigger lunatic asylum outside these prison walls that's why the yogya was reclosing escape who's in the Himalayas why do we come to this this\n02:02 - little space so that we get dressed and relaxed dissolve all our stress went out on our fear and anxiety but in a proper channelized way it's good to vent out you can do it anyway you can do it\n02:18 - anyhow but you have to move on time is fleeting and you can only move on by practicing Kriya yoga sincerely and on the other side giving what you have learned sharing and caring with with\n02:35 - humanity because they're a part of your larger self SP of just saying you cannot do without them we cannot selfishly say oh I'll slip ahead and let that I'll give that fellow the slip and go ahead\n02:47 - this is not business you know where you can do your Mac a billion tricks and said you have to send your head and dust and kidnap vice-presidents from one company\n02:57 - the company so not that game the more you give the more you get simplicity is the name of the game you know and all your people have a shield and you're very you know uptight because you feel\n03:16 - that if you're open and party to the word the word should eat you up but that will not happen if you are proper if you have nothing to lose you have everything to gain this is important\n03:46 - no we loved it but the question is this that death is fleeting time waits for no man so let's make the most let's realize God in this life otherwise when you die you\n04:05 - go through the whole process of limbo the bar note on the quadrant or another bottle which we gone in are the same David China we go through the whole process of gavage and Amos thumb both on\n04:20 - the astral sphere the pool of gold looks work Mahalo channel Oh Papa no satella you go through all these locusts then then you go to Pathan ha ha ha ha on the various Ellis for all the bad you've\n04:36 - done in all the various heavens for the good you've done so before this whole rigmarole starts then you take birth in a human body and come again where you can start your Kriya yoga again so I\n04:46 - started going around all the way like this you know death is certain time is breathing so let's catch it let's catch the train let's get our passport to paradise done in this life\n04:59 - stamped and clearly by the stamp of home car Samadhi Samadhi is the standard meditation is the stand so it's question of time we don't want to waste time we'd like to meet our beloved Lord at this\n05:15 - light in this life therefore with that is urgency we are saying because time is fleeting let not precious moments slip by seek now the ultimate truth o souls want\n05:30 - spread your wings to fly a motor revs which death-defying is the Swan flies back to the future for this you see I have shown you that in the human brain and you have the cardinal\n05:51 - cross sections of the brain there the lateral ventricles in the brain in the shape of a swan in flight with its wings thrust to the forehead and its head pointing back as though flying back to\n06:06 - the future' faster-than-light makes a lot of sense because when you transcend the sound barrier you go into a certain state of Samadhi when you transcend the light value you go into a state of never\n06:17 - cuts on it which is everywhere no way at the same time which is faster than light back to the future I have saved you the trouble of taking constant notes you can because this is all a lot of this is\n06:37 - given in my book wings to freedom I hope you have kept two copies for me because I don't yes is there any information in it how we can get more hobbies suppose we want to order from\n06:52 - India some people what do they do the order on amazon.com they could but they will get confused because the picture there is different in the picture of this yours new book is different if you\n07:06 - change who has done this the stupid publisher they don't know anything okay now before I begin the Kriya Yoga is the science of the evolution of human consciousness there\n07:25 - is no other important thing for you to be in this world that evolve your soul consciousness nothing is more important analyze it is your Ferrari more important to his evolution of soul\n07:39 - consciousness one is your husband more important of the evolution of your soul consciousness a billion dollars boy important or as the evolution of soul consciousness so if you analyze it one\n07:49 - by one all these material things will fall away in front of God then if that is the case you have logically convinced yourself then get on the job and practice Kriya yoga\n07:59 - like we are going to practice now so I am giving you the empowerment of the sacred science of selfing into the cell you when I'm giving the healing and",

with a big entourage of thousands of people or he's got big long hair which is 100 ft long and he's got it on the top of his head he cannot give you an experience I mean no insult or this\n03:21 - thing to anyone various people come in your minds but believe me I'm not being personal I'm just telling you the truth the litmus test is is the experience if he cannot give you the\n03:32 - experience don't take it from him so when you say that c is the lightning path um is that the technique or is that combined with the uh experience that's given by the master\n03:52 - it's combined with the experience it takes you long it pushes your breath along if you I think you had it or not had it I don't know when I breathe through the breath I lengthen your\n04:01 - breath and I push it up and down right I don't blame you there's a supermarket of yoga here and there are thousands of teachers in\n04:16 - America I am an ignorant man but in America I do not know if there are any Masters now after yoganand I don't think there are yogan Vian was there yoganand came shival Yogi\n04:31 - came from a very for a very short time uh he was there but there are teachers there are there are very famous teachers and uh we we should respect them for what they are\n04:44 - and honor them they do give the experience of Soul Consciousness and they're a mastered this is the simple test there's no argument or words about it it's the simple test there many\n04:55 - shamanistic teachers this thing they're great they context but they call themselves in light Masters no but they may be there's a thick book I think he showed me in that let's give him a\n05:06 - chance let's go and they're all enlightened Masters and if they can Enlighten you or give you the soul Consciousness or breathe through your breath well hats off not only you but I\n05:15 - will also follow you and learn from them but if you take me to some hug Hocus Pocus places don't waste my time take me to a genuine Master I'll come with you I'll sit at his feet and\n05:28 - I'll learn but through all my 50 years plus of meditation I've done I don't think that I can miss the M I think I can see a little you people\n05:40 - may see a lot in America I could see a little and my judgment never misses by the grace of God and Baba so the experience is the only litness test\n05:52 - another thing I found that people hallucinate themselves into an experience and they throw into a TR and frzy and they say I've got to walk in I've got the walk walking and this who\n06:01 - is this it's Oracle of dely it's I can see in the a there's no damn thing going on it's a it's a white lie they're making a a f of it and then I say what are you doing oh you burst my\n06:14 - bubble I said the master is here to burst your bubbles teacher can give you this thing even in India we have this hypocrisy they will put Tiger Bomb on\n06:25 - their eyes and the tears will drop and say what devotion the damn tiger B is burning the eyes and the tears are flowing out you say the thing is a devotion and they're crying a devotion\n06:36 - oh there never was a Bor there is great B is a b going on 24 hours backy whenever I see I see him crying he a back te so whenever you come and he puts on the tiger bom and the tears of say oh\n06:50 - Lord so there are people like this I have seen this they post to be as Divine Master they say see if you're natural you're\n07:03 - natural any Master the first thing is playfulness the child will come out because there are no inhibitions this is important and you\n07:16 - don't have to put on anything if you're confident of yourself you give the experience any time if you're ready which you'll see tomorrow a group that is so Advanced and so serious I do not\n07:27 - believe that even one of you will not get the experience I am very confident that all of you should get all the experiences that I\n07:39 - give but if there should be a stray sheep here and there little lamp just run astray or little tense I'll deal with it in the night and you'll get this good sleep and you'll be\n07:51 - healed and worked upon om [Music]",

yog it is a lifestyle a heavy detoxification is taking place in the body breaths per minut K four breaths\n02:25 - per minute insan 60 breaths per minute so it it is always said that the quicker you breathe the shorter your lifespan the longer your breath like the giant\n02:44 - tortoise which breathes four breaths per minute he lives for 400 years elephant has 16 breaths per minute he lives for 100 years man has about 60 to 70 breaths per minute he lives for about uh 80\n02:58 - years so s is a scientific process I do not tell anybody to follow any religion I do not tell anybody to be of a particular Faith or Creed I tell\n03:25 - them just scientifically practice the Kaa yog with Focus attention and you shall reach the goal so K\n03:37 - yog breathing it in of course pure air which you will find in the early hours of the morning you will detoxify your system it's a very healthy\n03:59 - process or somewhere in Middle East Africa family mitrochondrial gen\n04:27 - metrial Gene the whole world we are direct brothers and sisters this is a very joyful thought I\n04:37 - mean if we are direct brothers and sisters and here we shooting out at one another killing violently but I wish it were true and I feel that a lot of it makes sense we are\n04:49 - one human being We Are One Consciousness but you must not intellectualize with me you must connect my my heart with your heart form the Golden Gate bridge and then I\n05:04 - will connect with you and give you the pr your PR and it is very necessary I am a server of humanity\n05:54 - lecture lecture lecture lecture lecture Hotel we must share our spiritual wealth in experience and in form with everybody who\n06:26 - comes otherwise talk is talk so when I throw my PR my chitan PR in your pric schwas to be technical you have already\n07:02 - been given anugraha Anu means self home you have entered yourself home by breathing with my breath this is spiritual intimacy this\n07:15 - is spiritual intimacy when the master throws his breath and is breathing his breath through the disciple that is what called is called closeness not like just go and say hi and you hug someone and\n07:27 - all still you're separate but here the breath and the pran and the chaitan breath has been mixed showing to humanity that we are one taking that we're going to do the\n07:38 - Kaa yoga religiously or with our hearts and all that and how is it going to help our loved ones we are doing it and we're going to give our energy and for the betterment of everybody but if you're\n07:54 - talking about a catastrophe and things like that then how is it that we can make a difference to our loved ones who may not be doing the same thing that we do okay I want to ask you a counter\n08:03 - question how would not doing Kaa yog help your loved ones it would not help either way right so we are quits on that question we are quits so not doing it not doing it would\n08:18 - not help you know your loved ones but doing it would help you and encourage your loved ones to come here but the answer is even better yes it will help your loved ones if they ATT tuned to you\n08:31 - and you let them know I'm doing Kaa yog for you definitely it's going to have a pacifying effect and it'll give them a lot of courage and support it's a good support system and try to bring them\n08:43 - later to do it because it's a science it's not a religion it's a scientific technique of it sooths the nerves calms the mind and detoxifies the whole system it's the fastest method of\n08:56 - detoxification okay and this is different from the Surya CCH the sua cabage is the first detoxification which is a heavy detox and it it fills you with light and protection it is to\n09:06 - protect your body again and keep you away from accidents premature death all ill happenings because the Surya is the king of the mandal the rashim mandal is ruled by the suria it's common sense if\n09:19 - there's no sunshine for 2 or 3 years all life on Earth will die away right so he we are floating in the soup of the sunlight and in him we live and move and have our being so suryan Naran is our\n09:36 - immediate God the other Lord God you cannot see but Surya you can see every day he is our immediate God and benefactor you know what I would love to do I would\n09:46 - love to invite you to my ashram in the in the forest of the Simard Hills near Puna it's a beautiful Forest we have deers and peacocks and season and it takes you 5,000 years back in time\n10:00 - because we have thatched hearts and little like mud houses at least the imitation like that uh and we have this Temple and so you can stay there overnight it's really wonderful that's\n10:11 - why I teach the Kaa yog and it's very very good it's very rewarding pun asham you'll get to see the the world's biggest akand shivling which is concealed of Paras Mani which\n10:23 - we call parasmani that is in the temple so you'll get an opportunity to meditate there and still your mind it is a High soundcar alchemical Mercury shivling Consolidated Mercury and they say in the\n10:36 - shastras K Paras the Shing parades is the highest Shing which anyone can ever have more than emerald more than Diamond more than gold more than silver so we have one of\n10:50 - the biggest parasmani shivlings or the biggest in the world which is aand and has 18 sound scars guruji I wanted to ask you could you tell us uh some more about Kaa yog\n11:03 - so I've only read it about it in books Kaa yog is a spinal process it is breathing it is called the sacred fire right of the yogi there are two currents involved in the practice of Kaa yog one\n11:18 - is the pric current which flows from the muladar chakra to the Aya chakra",

          "transcript": "00:06 - we have cycles of time okay now i have always believed that the yuga's satya yoga dwapar yoga and treta yog you know kaliyug\n00:22 - dwapuryug treta yogan satyayug these are the four yogas the cycles of time where human souls pass through and they evolve to subtler innovations\n00:35 - to subtle ideologies to more spiritual you know behavior the yogas are lengthened and shortened by the\n00:47 - degree of concentration of that individual soul so there is a cyclic yoga which is of humanity and there's an\n00:59 - individual yogas which you go through very fast now they say when you're in the presence of a master you're in the golden age when you're before the satguru you're\n01:10 - always in the golden age you see his golden aura you see the purple star of the east you are enveloped in the white golden light as only few people saw that all of us were in that envelope what\n01:20 - does that mean you are all in the golden age you're in a different dimension with the master you're not in a material dimension\n01:30 - you're in a spiritual dimension so they were saying that some people said that oh we have to adjust these yogas according to mechanical mathematics which we\n01:40 - respect my experience of this is totally different the human evolution is fulfilled let us say if you take it materially\n01:49 - the speed of light is 300 000 kilometers per second 300 000 kilometers right per second\n01:60 - the masters have fulfilled this awful condition that they have broken the space-time continuum for said of babaji\n02:10 - today i have seen the conqueror of death today i have seen the lord of death for him no time no space exists\n02:25 - and he is the holder of the keys of heaven and hell so now the thing is like this that we have many degrees of initiation say the first degree is a dwight\n02:37 - second degree is a parivrajak okay the hamsa savak third degree is the hamsa fourth degree is the paramahamsa fifth\n02:47 - is the siddha after the fourth degree human evolution is complete the fifth degree is superhuman evolution\n02:56 - so as we pass along the yogas we have in our consciousness when we do the kriya at the first stage\n03:09 - we travel at say the 20 the speed of light okay that is the stage of the dwight the initiate he who has entered the stream he who has entered the current of light\n03:27 - travels at 20 percent the speed of light and not his body his spiritual consciousness because it's still encumbered by\n03:37 - astral body or the celestial bodies then when he becomes a hamsa or a parivrajaka his body travels\n03:54 - at 40 the speed of light because it is kriya his concentration increases then as he evolves through his own personal yoga\n04:10 - he goes to the state of the hamsa where he is traveling at 60 percent the speed of light approximately 160 000 miles per second\n04:26 - he's traveling in his own spine it's called the lightning path remember then as he evolves from the stage of the hamsa he goes to the stage of the\n04:39 - paramahamsa which is the final there he travels at the per speed of 80 percent of the speed of light is able to break the crown chakra and occasionally go to 100\n04:50 - percent 80 percent 100 percent so when he goes to 100 he goes to the final samadhi at the speed of light he has broken the light barrier and he is\n05:01 - infinite but it's temporary then when the fifth stage he becomes a siddha he travels at 100 the speed of light he has entered satya yoga he is\n05:11 - not shackled by his karma he is everywhere nowhere at the same time his mass is infinite the siddha beyond the siddha three states which are the\n05:22 - sixth degree the seventh degree is the avatar they are way beyond the speed of light and we do not know the nature of their work exactly not the complete nature\n05:33 - and then the avatar the seventh degree is beyond the speed of light back to the future he comes down again he comes it was a downward crossing means descent\n05:51 - when the avatar descends he cannot descend in all that power he has to lessen his power to accommodate himself to the limited understanding of human beings\n06:00 - right and when he gets there then he stretches his hand across to soul stuck in the mire the delusion illusion and error of\n06:10 - materialism and he plucks them out of their plight and brings them home through the boat through the pranav the first boat the\n06:20 - light and breath of sound so he is called the great redeemer the after is the redeemer the emancipator\n06:31 - but shiva or babaji they are the they are the dissolver redeemer they destroy the destroyer redeemer they\n06:42 - destroy the evil and redeem the righteous soul and destroy the disease decay and death in human beings and redeem his soul so at 100 the speed of light\n06:56 - it is the siddha the perfected being and in the satya yoga you will all be 100 speed of light and you will all be in the satty yoga 500 years hence that's that is the special satyagu so\n07:10 - there are yogas within yoga cycles within cycles from the minutest second to the vastest cosmic cycle have you understood what i'm saying\n07:26 - this talks about individual evolution in the in the the moving of the world disciple into satya yoga so when the world disciple moves at that\n07:35 - speed that means the yogas will move too the yogas will move too and they will move in such a manner that those years\n07:46 - will be completed by that speed the evolution and the yugas are depending uh you know it's not earth traveling at 20 the speed of light or the earth around the planet it's the\n07:59 - consciousness which travels around at the speed of light and makes its yoga at the proper time the earth remains the same so this is again a mistake by western calculators\n08:11 - and scientists they're calculating by the physical movement of the earth the star the sun and the moons the yogas but it is the movement of consciousness\n08:36 - you",

          "transcript": "00:00 - Oh [Music] Oh warum a wash you should be [Music] rajab cannot be considered different\n00:21 - meditate with any meditation consider being a capo Roger and and how does one now different teachers like Maruyama yoga might say that TM is the best way best meditation is one say with your\n00:42 - fastest number 1 all parts lead to God is that clear now you want the best part the best part will be the part which suits your temperament the most now you are the best guru the best guru is he\n01:14 - who can give you an experience and not talk because if a guide talks is not a master he is a teacher it will be much slower for you to take initiation from a teacher and spiritually evolved than to\n01:30 - take initiation from the master and how will you know a simple master with five disciples from a word famous teacher who through propaganda and publicity has made himself known\n01:43 - the world how would you know that and would you go to the teacher who has tens of millions of people as his disciples and is very famous or would you would you go to the master who will give you\n01:57 - the experience of God what would you do what would you do yes so but how would you know the difference between a monastery teacher experienced the litmus test is\n02:17 - experiencing he would be able to give you an experience breathe through your breath give his soul consciousness to you and give you our body give you the flight of your soul conscience still\n02:29 - your mind for you so if he's actually helping you check the blood thinner oh this year he's doing Patanjali for you in your mind it's the dumber than dumber than the dumbest would know that a\n02:40 - master who can control your mind and who is teaching you yoga by actually stealing your thoughts which is the first maximum the first principle of perfectly it is he you should go to\n02:53 - whoever he may be never take things for the outward show but the feather flies I got a pearlized low so if there's a fellow with a big enter Roger thousands of people or his got big long hair which\n03:06 - is 100 feet long and he's got a tall the top of his head he cannot give you an experience I mean no insert oh this thing to anyone various people come in your minds but believe me I am NOT being\n03:17 - personal I am just telling you the truth the litmus test is the experience if he cannot give you the experience don't take it from me\n03:33 - how does that the technique or that combined with the experience combined with the experience it takes me along and pushes your breath along if you think you've had it come out have you\n03:49 - had remember when I bring through the breath and lengthen your breath an actor should have been down but I don't blame you there's a supermarket of you over here\n04:01 - and there are thousands of teachers in America I am an ignorant man but in America I do not know if there are any masters now after Yogananda I don't think there are yoga and\n04:19 - Vivekanand was there johanna came Chuvalo yogi came from a very short time he was there but there are teachers there are there are very famous teachers and we should respect them for what they\n04:35 - are known of them they do give the experience of soul consciousness in their master this is the simple test there's no argument towards a woman it's the simple test there many shamanistic\n04:47 - teachers this thing they raped in context but they call themselves enlightened masters nope but they maybe there is a thick book I think he showed me in that against giving a chance let's\n04:57 - go and they are all enlightened masters and if they can enlighten you I'll give you the soul consciousness or read through your breath where that so not only you but I will also follow you and\n05:08 - learn from them but if you take you to some Bacchus focus place it don't waste my time take me to a genuine master I'll come with you I'll sit at his feet and I'll\n05:19 - learn but throughout my 50 years plus or meditation I've done I don't think that I can miss them out I think I can see a little you people may see a lot in\n05:32 - America I could see a little in my judgement never misses by the grace of God in poverty so the experience is donated plus test another thing I found that people reducing it themselves into\n05:46 - an experience early to accept into a trance in frenzy and they say I've got to walk in it walking and this loses its Oracle of Delphi so I can see the order there's no damn thing going on it's a\n05:57 - it's a white lie they're making a farce of it and then I say what are you doing it oh you burst my bubble I said the master is here to burst your bubbles teacher can give you this thing even in\n06:12 - India we have this hypocrisy they were put tiger balm on the eyes and the tears will prophesy harm what devotion - tiger balm is burning the eyes and the tears are flowing out you say they're\n06:25 - thick as a devotion and the crying devotion oh there never was a part - there is a great doctor is about to going on 24 hours bhakti whenever I see I see em crying is about T so whenever\n06:38 - you come in he puts on the tiger balm and the jerseylicious old objectivity so there are people like this I have seen this the post where's divine master - says Sahadi\n06:51 - see if you're naturally a naturally any master the first thing is playfulness the child will come out because there are no inhibitions this is and you don't have to put on anything if you are\n07:09 - confident of yourself you get the experience anytime if you're ready but you will see you tomorrow a group that is so advanced and so serious I do not believe that even one of you will not\n07:20 - get the experience I am very confident that all of you should get all the experiences that I give party if they should be a stray sheep here in their little lamp\n07:37 - just run a straight or as little tense I'll deal with it in the night and you get this good sleep and you'll be healed and what about next question Oh Warren Amida Buddha\n07:54 - Poornima da de horas de una ma Oh [Music]",

          "transcript": "00:00 - oh the only purpose of man sergeant on this earth is to seek God we have cycles of time okay now I have always believed that the yoga's sati yoke guapa yolk and treta-yuga\n00:23 - you know Kali oak dwapar yuga treta yuga and sati oak these are the four Yuga's the cycles of time where human souls pass through and they evolved to settler innovations to satellite ideologies to\n00:42 - more spiritual you know behavior the yoga's are lengthened and shortened by the degree of concentration of that individual soul so there is a cyclic yoga which is of humanity and there's an\n01:04 - individual yoga's which you go through very fast now they say when you are in the presence of a master you're in the Golden Age when you're before the Satguru you always in the Golden Age you\n01:17 - see as golden aura you see the purple star of the East you are enveloped in the white golden light as only a few people saw that all of us were in there enveloped what does that mean you are\n01:27 - all in the Golden Age you're in a different dimension with the master you're not in a material dimension you're in a spiritual dimension so they were saying that some people said that\n01:40 - oh we have to adjust these yoga's according to mechanical mathematics which we respect my experience of this is totally different the human evolution is fulfilled let us say if you take it\n01:52 - materially the speed of light is 300,000 kilometers per second three hundred thousand kilometers right per second the Masters have fulfilled this awful condition that they have broken the\n02:09 - space-time continuum for lahiri mahasaya said of Babaji today I have seen the Conqueror of death today I have seen the Lord of death for him no time no space\n02:28 - exists and he is the holder of the keys of heaven and hell so now the thing is like this that we have many degrees of initiation say the first degree is a bridge second degree is a part of Rajic\n02:45 - okay the hamsa sabic third degree is the hamsa fourth degree is the paramhamsa fifth is the Siddha after the fourth degree human evolution is complete the fifth degree is super human evolution\n03:01 - so as we pass along the yoga's we have in our consciousness when we do the Kriya at the first stage we travel at say the 20% the speed of light okay that is the stage of the dredge the initiate\n03:26 - he who has entered the stream he who has entered the current of light travels at 20% the speed of light he not his body his spiritual consciousness because it's still encumbered by astral body or the\n03:44 - celestial bodies then when he becomes a hamsa or a parivrajaka his body travels at 40% the speed of light because it is Kriya his concentration increases then as he\n04:11 - evolves through his own personal yoga he goes to the state of the hamsa where he is travelling at 60 percent the speed of light approximately 160,000 miles per second\n04:30 - he's travelling in his own spine it's called the lightning path remember then as he evolves from the stage of the hamsa he goes to the stage of the paramhamsa which is the final there he\n04:48 - travels at the Pearl speed of 80 percent of the speed of light is able to break the crown chakra and occasionally go to 100 percent 80 percent 100 percent so when he goes to a hundred percent he\n05:00 - goes to the final samadhi at the speed of light he has broken the light barrier and he is infinite but it's temporary then went the fifth stage he becomes a sin that travels at 100% the speed of\n05:13 - light he has entered sati yoga he is not shackled by his Karma he is everywhere no were at the same time his mass is infinite the cinder beyond the cinder three states which are the are\n05:26 - toothed the sixth degree the seventh degree is the avatar they are way beyond the speed of light and we do not know the nature of their work exactly not the complete nature and then they are\n05:38 - thought the seventh degree is beyond the speed of light back to the future he comes down again he comes it was a downward crossing however through 'va through other\n05:54 - means descent so when the avatar descends he cannot descend in all that power he has to lessen his power to accommodate himself to the limited understanding of human beings right and\n06:06 - when he gets there then he stretches his hand across two souls stuck in the mire the delusion illusion an error of materialism and he plucks them out of their plight and\n06:18 - brings them home through the boat through the front of the first boat the light and breath of sound so he is called the great Redeemer the avatar is the Redeemer the Emancipator\n06:35 - but Shiva Oh Baba ji they are the they are the dissolver Redeemer they destroy the destroyer Redeemer they destroy the evil and redeemed the righteous soul and destroy the disease decay and death in\n06:54 - human beings and redeem his soul so at 100% the speed of light it is a Siddha the perfected being and in the sati oak he will all be 100% speed of light and he will all be in the sati oak five\n07:09 - hundred years hence that's that is the special Satya so they are UGA's within yuga cycles within cycles from the my nearest second to the vastest cosmic cycle have you understood what I am\n07:26 - saying this talks about individual evolution in the in the the moving of the world disciple into sati yoke so when the world disciple moves at that speed that means the yoga's will move to\n07:43 - the yoga's will move to and they will move in such a manner that those years will be completed by that speed the evolution and the yoga's are depending you know it's not earth traveling at\n07:59 - twenty percent the speed of light or the earth round the planet it's the consciousness which travels around at the speed of and makes its yoga at the proper time\n08:10 - the earth remains the same so this is again a mistake by Western calculators and scientists they're calculating by the physical movement of the earth the star the Sun in the moon's the yoga's\n08:23 - but it is the movement of consciousness",

sabatham therma mean by God and how does the realize master experience God [Music] two questions in length according to Senate endeavor what is God okay how do\n00:41 - you experience enough I can tell you about myself nobody can at any time describe God for thousands of years people have been trying to disprove God all the atheists\n01:04 - and the Gnostics they&#39;ve been trying to disprove God and they have failed for thousands of years Yogi&#39;s and men have been trying to intellectually prove God they have also failed because I know\n01:24 - that God is not a subject of intellectual speculation God is that the being of direct realization is not a subject of intellectual speculation you have to sit down\n01:41 - practice the necessary means to achieve God and experience him this is the most important thing so he cannot be described perfectly in any Dharma with its the Christianity or\n01:57 - Islam of sanatana-dharma or Buddhism we point the way we try to tell you an idea of what God is what no one can really describe him in his entire show in one of my poems I&#39;ve said this world is but\n02:19 - a thoughtfulness of mi&#39;ek atoms intertwined whose electrons are energy of lightest and sublime they start my point like this then I go on to a page I&#39;m I&#39;m not saying the point but picking\n02:36 - out verses this world our sages did perceive is mind stuff materialized in relative sequence it is built deceiving mortal eyes all that is composed then you must get\n02:56 - decomposed where then does reality lie all matter being composed when I say supreme reality I mean God they don&#39;t use the word God is it&#39;s very blase it&#39;s become very common all that is composed\n03:12 - the new muscat decomposed where than does reality lie all matter being composed then the yogi in his limited words he tells you what God is all that is composed then you must get decomposed\n03:27 - where then does reality lie all matter being composed then he says that all-pervading consciousness of stillness through eternity must of necessity proclaim its ultimate reality all that\n03:43 - is composed then you must get decomposed where then does reality lie all matter being composed then he says that all-pervading consciousness of stillness through eternity must of necessity\n03:56 - proclaim its ultimate reality composed of nothing yet over Cholan says show composed it stands supreme beyond our dreams eternally reposed this is my description or pointer to workout maybe\n04:15 - there&#39;s no religion the Christian the Hindu the Muslim the Parsee the priest the the Papa the king everyone can accept this explanation is we not stuck on names\n04:28 - they ask me what do you experience Gurunath as Deon I&#39;m not telling what the the Sanatan dharm says not because it says well very similar to what my experiences since\n04:39 - what he experienced in Arabic Alpha Samadhi the alien enterica items are no Vevey Gurunath what the experience will not when you go to the higher state of nirvikalpa samadhi so then I&#39;ve made a\n04:50 - little one which shivraj is some very beautifully Bahat Han and Astana no not in a bin there is no time-space Inquisition there Vardhan understand and a nod and a Bandhan Akashi nahi Mahakali\n05:07 - kaha there is no time no space no space time continuum submission yoshinaka happen here everything is the isness of the 0 not 0 he should be near on carbon even God is\n05:25 - without attributes formless and pure awareness Mahad on Aniston and and Aden have been Akashi like Eva Hakka durka ha savasana should naka happen here he\n05:36 - should be near on carbon al akhirin Janome Shalom alakh niranjan rome Shiva absolutely sublime absolutely sublime I really got that that it is a subliminal experience beyond time and space and\n05:56 - form and it is it is an experience it is to be expelled in here it is to be known and there&#39;s nothing else to describe it other than the way that you just done it you cannot really describe God because\n06:15 - I&#39;ve made efforts in my poetry&#39;s are you all okay with the English then Stiller then stillness itself thence Stiller then stillness itself with bated breath I do behold I&#39;m trying to describe God\n06:40 - I&#39;ve got any experience of God now just just look I&#39;m getting experience of God I&#39;m trying to describe Impa near gonna rock on experience I&#39;m trying to describe then Stiller than stillness\n06:50 - itself with bated breath I do behold my rising self Suns nectar gold i dissolved in that mystery untold you cannot gue never gonna hammer one when you go to that Spade you&#39;re gone you have too much\n07:15 -

solstar and come back to you the Satguru is a rinpoche okay so the sitting before you is the rinpoche not the rinpoche in the tibetan sense every second fellow calls himself for rinpoche\n00:51 - that's not a rinpoche but Masson bob was the rinpoche but massamba Siddhartha Shakyamuni was the Rinpoche but massamba was a rinpoche the third one is a secret name you don't know his\n01:07 - shank Appa was a ring shape Rinpoche from a ham dough and he was the one who promulgated that people like us or in poche should come not every thousand years not every 2,000 years but every\n01:23 - hundred years he took permission from the higher rinpoche is from Babaji the adi buddha shiv goraksha babaji and gotham siddharth buddha that the earth has got\n01:35 - too much muck there's too much dust and too much BS in the minds of the people who are transmigrating from the level of the legend and the choral to the level of fish the level of fish to the level\n01:48 - of the amphibians like the crocodiles level so from plants to crocodiles amphibians to then the level of animals and animals they carry on till the levels of the finer dogs the the horses\n02:02 - were highly intelligent than the Apes and ships and then finally the the cro-magnon man and then the the africanus man and the Neanderthal man and then ask the cro-magnon man\n02:12 - there's too much of the the passional nature and nature of distraction and ruthless killing which is still in the rational man and therefore the man himself who is\n02:27 - divine or Souls you are potentially divine you have God within you but you also have the brute within you so it is my work to transform you from and the brute to man the man to man the god some\n02:43 - of you at the level of man the man and man the God some of you are getting - none of you are banned the brute but in the whole world sin are you I can't say that there is man the brute who are\n02:54 - killing more human beings today I'm sorry to make the statement that human beings or even dogs and cats in the United States of America have more respect and self-esteem than human\n03:08 - beings in the Middle East who are being killed and slaughtered like leaves in a storm they're being scattered and decapitated is that right or wrong I so what is the value of human life the\n03:22 - United Minds the United Nations organizations are not able to do anything about this and therefore I've suggested before and I suggest again that let there be your souls a United\n03:31 - Minds organization whereby we can go forth in one body to the United Nations and say look a United Minds organization maybe we will demonstrate to you by breathing through your breath and giving\n03:42 - you a no mind that you at the level of consciousness humanity as one and humanity is tied by the self same code of breath through love I went to the United Nations that gave it but to no\n03:54 - avail no avail and Gurunath has been like this for thirty years none of you have taken the step with me to improve I expand the organization now we have an organization\n04:09 - set in place maybe out of turn or in turn I don't know but I thank that organization to setting us together first each of you ran away with guru dodge shut him up in your own little\n04:19 - cupboard and everyday we had the same amount of people not expanding the message of the only master you have here who can breathe through your breath and I'm\n04:27 - prepared to step aside if anybody is there and can breathe through your breath and give you the enlightening experience of Shiva path and show you the rainbow light Tibet you've just\n04:37 - talked of rainbow body rainbow body I'm showing it to you dumbbell every day wake up and some of you who are with me can see it even now as I said the fault is not in my rainbow body of seven\n04:49 - colors it's perfectly there around me violet indigo blue green yellow orange red the fault is in the the discrepancy or the paucity of your your intuition and your clairvoyance the moment your\n05:01 - clairvoyance in increases and it's purified by Kriya yoga here I am sitting with before you and my rainbow body yes this is an open challenge to any atheist to any doubter or non-believer clarify\n05:15 - your mind and body and see the aura around this guru I have to tell you the truth so I have to shed false modesty and tell you that here sitteth before you the\n05:25 - rainbow body he has said that before you the man who can do the bar at all every night with you and prepare you for the clear light and the ultimate moment of reckoning as the Christians called the\n05:36 -

I've already started transforming you I just want you to let go and be open that's all I ask of you the contract between you and me it's a fair contract you do nothing I do everything but the\n07:09 - only condition what you have to do is really relax and do nothing which that even you cannot do and therefore your subconscious mind inhibits my healing if you are open to being conscious\n07:24 - subconscious and causal mind sky's the limit for me I can transform you in the here now truth alive you",

          "transcript": "00:20 - and uh I had the good uh fortune and good opportunity to meet the Great spiritual being called H\n00:34 - salasa he was the called the Conquering Lion of Judah conquering Lion of Judah so this was a great opportunity and I I felt uh very humbled and I felt very joyous at the same\n00:50 - time to have met him uh this was in the year 1981 I think I mentioned it in my book I don't know exactly is it 81 or 82 not\n01:04 - 82 and that time I was very young and he was in nearing his 9s or [Music] something great experience to meet such\n01:26 - a spiritual being he was not an ordinary being he was a spiritual master and his work was very difficult because he took on a lot of karma a lot of hardships from the people of Ethiopia\n01:47 - these Souls had to pass through these tribulations they had to pass through trials to get to the Eternal Heavens to get to the Eternal space the space of God so he had he was preparing this\n02:02 - space of God for not only the people of Ethiopia but people all over the [Music] worldes time even before the time of Moses the Ethiopian culture was one of\n02:27 - the highly civilized cultures in the world along with the Indus Valley Civilization and the sarasti civilization of India some people had said that his\n02:48 - majesty had already gone he had taken his samadi he had died that that was the rumors but some people the restar people and other people that feel that he he came back from his body because I met\n03:07 - him in 1982 and he was declared dead in 1970 sometime in 1970 right 197 1975 and I met him in\n03:21 - 1982 that means like the Christ he has either risen from the dead woo so this is a this is a thing which I it's a very spiritual thing I won't want to go into this I'm going to\n03:36 - leave it to you to contemplate and see what this great Master done and that he was there and he expressed to have a fire ceremony that time he was nearing 100 he\n03:53 - was [Music] his question was that when I wrote in my book that I met his majesty uh H Salas uh in 1982 the\n04:13 - question was did anybody challenge you because he was already dead in 1975 and or did anybody want to question you on that so I felt that the raran community had a great uh sense of oh it\n04:31 - was surprise and they did not challenge because they knew and they felt that his majesty had power to resurrect you understand and those who rers who wanted\n04:46 - to challenge did not have the courage because they knew that the that his majesty the after all he is he is from the house of of Solomon and of the house of shba and this is a very sacred\n05:01 - thing he he is he is a Divine being and a Divine being can do anything and and I think you [Music] see mind of different people are more\n05:24 - are different so the the mind in Africa is more open they're not closed they're not in they do believe yes a spirit can come an angel can appear Christ can bless you H\n05:35 - salasi can meet you as long as you have that hope he can come and meet you you can feel his presence you can feel him talking through me so once you open up your heart nothing is\n05:53 - [Music] impossible nothing is impossible God is Not impossible only the stupid mind is impossible which keeps tripping over its\n06:06 - own doubts and then ultimately if the Mind keeps doubting doubting doubting it gets analysis paralysis and dies the moment your mind dies God Appears God is no\n06:21 - mind God is and when the Mind disappears God appears as long as the mind is there God chooses to be in the background because the mind is evil is piping up all the time and trumpeting it own Glory\n06:36 - I did this and I did that and I did here and I there so this is what these are the sort of discussions I had with his majesty and he was very intrigued in the science of yog in the science of K yog\n06:47 - and breathing and he practiced it and when he practiced it he saw the result also he is a very very ancient Soul come from the Divine SP he's not only born in this\n07:07 - life he tens of thousands and thousands of years old that soul is tens of thousands and millions of years [Applause] [Music]\n07:25 - old definitely he is such a power that if you invoke him in medit he can come he's more than an ordinary Soul this is the\n07:38 - message all of you aware of in the League of Nations he was there and there's a story about him that one person came and he held a pistol and a revolver he wanted\n07:59 - to shoot him and his majesty just turned he had nothing in his hand and he just looked at him like this and that that man's hand went down\n08:11 - and he dropped the revolver so that shows the power of the Soul that's a Divine Soul power no ordinary person can do that that is one of the most powerful things to meet to change within a split\n08:25 - second an aggressive person and change him into a doile person later a friendly person is I think A great miracle and one of the greatest Miracles ever performed on a public platform so I was\n08:41 - very impressed with this and there are many stories of this which uh are so anent but there are people who know what he did and who he was and certainly one of the great gifts\n09:04 - to humanity he did his work and went although it appeared that he left certain places and Ethiopia was not properly cared for but High command even higher forces than in God's power said\n09:18 - that certain people have to go through certain surgery they have to go through certain suffering so that that they will become as stronger soul in in our\n09:32 - philosophy in the the religion of Truth as I am an existentialist I am a realist and according to reality you can never die you're not this house of Flesh and\n09:49 - Bone you're not this house of Flesh and Bon which sleeps decays and dies you're not this house of Flesh and B it sleeps decays and dies you are Immortal\n10:04 - Consciousness lord of the earth and the skies all of you are this and the thing with his majesty the Divine thing he he have realized it you have not that's the difference so if you\n10:17 - practice you will also realize [Applause] [Music] that come up on the world scenario yeah because the souls who are\n10:36 - there will always be there they keep changing you know they keep changing their outer courtes their bodies but the inner man is the same the inner person is always the same and if you practice\n10:50 - spiritual techniques you can get the spiritual",

          "transcript": "00:02 - the only purpose of man's sergeant on this earth is to seek god yes how does one locate the chakras while meditating i've been trying it for\n00:16 - some time now but uh i'm not sure whether i'm hitting the right spots and am i just imagining that i'm seeing the things and i've heard\n00:25 - okay now question was how do you locate the chakras in the spinal cord there are two ways of doing it the teacher he says locate the chakras\n00:37 - he gives you the exact spots he says okay now this the six chakras are in the third eye two and a half inches deep\n00:51 - in the center of the skull there is the third ventricle it's a hollow space in yogic palance it is called the brahma gopha or the brahmar ghofa\n01:05 - so if you prick up in from here and you pick up in from here two and a half to three inches where they intersect that is the place of\n01:16 - the adna chakra it takes the adna from the guru chakra admiral above that at the trans-personal point is the thousand-petaled lotus\n01:28 - the sahastra dal kamal sahasra chakra which corresponds to the corona radiata of the brain the sahasrara chakra this the the other chakra which is the adna chakra\n01:45 - would correspond exactly to the uh it would be between the thalamus the hypothalamus gland the thalamus gland forms the wall the\n02:00 - hypothalamus the floor and the choroid ventricle the roof and that space is called the third ventricle if you want to know it exactly\n02:09 - in medical plants you can check it up from the text from grey's anatomy or whatever anatomy you have but we knew it because one doctor said don't you have\n02:19 - your own word for why do you using our words i said i say you didn't you didn't uh you know invent these glands or the human body or they\n02:28 - say what's your problem so therefore i said yes there are there are equivalents to this it is called the brahmagava that is the third one is if you take\n02:39 - your thumb and put it right back you get to the nape of the neck from the adna chakra you go to the vishuddha chakra nape of the neck that is the third\n02:49 - chakra 16 petals thousand petals two petals in the astral 108 petals in the celestial sphere 16 petals at the vishuddha chakra\n03:12 - now this is exactly located you hit yourself and you get a soft spot the moment you get the soft spot touch yourself touch the soft spot here that\n03:24 - is the the seat of the anandakanda so the ananda khan the meditation is is the place where is a repository it it is it is the oh what do you what what could i say\n03:44 - it is the memory banks of your past karmas the memory banks past memories are held here so when you hit this and do the talker kriya here your past\n03:58 - karmas are worked out very fast very scientific don't try it don't do it okay so you're asking me i'm giving you this image don't don't don't even dare to go there unless\n04:08 - you're initiated okay because then we have to take responsibility for what you do it you have to be careful so that that is the chakra little within it is the ananda\n04:20 - kanda where the see which is the seat of the sword the seat of the karma of all individuals then you go below is the naval chakra manipur chakra you\n04:35 - put your thumbs in the navel when you prick a pin in your navel and you go to the back that is the the green lotus after the twelve petal\n04:42 - golden lotus there is the ten petaled green lotus of saman pran i'm talking about the pranas then is the genital area where you have the the next\n04:55 - swadeshtan chakra is not at the tail bone it's at the sacral tailbone which is two inches above the floor you can touch your sacrifice touch it\n05:06 - with your right thumb you'll see there's a tailbone two inches or three inches above the floor have you got the tailbone sacral tailbone okay then\n05:15 - the muladhara chakra which is the four petaled red lotus is between the genitals and the rectum there is a space called the perennium\n05:26 - that is where the mulatta chakra is have i told you exactly where it is okay do this do this touch with your right finger here and left finger here\n05:44 - see the intersection point that is the adna chakra okay that's the first this is the first chakra to do this touch at the center\n05:57 - and a little above going in the head and out of the head is the sahasrara chakra the second chakra is the admira chakra do this be quick about it please don't dream and please don't sleep there's no\n06:09 - time this we can't we can't wait for god we can wait for anything else third chakra is take your thumb like this put it at the back nape of the neck\n06:18 - that's the vishuddha chakra four chakras below the sternum the soft spot touch it with your right hand with the right thumb that's the anat chakra fifth one put\n06:28 - your thumbs in your navel that is the manipur chakra the green lotus right at the back they're all in the spine facing down when the kundalini awakens\n06:37 - those lotuses face up so dasha parna padma then with your thumb right thumb touch the tailbone at the back sacral tailbone\n06:48 - okay then the last one is between the genitals and the rectum there's the perineum the coccygeal tailbone just above the cockatoo tailbone is the four petal load\n06:58 - lotus called the muladhara chakra so is the what do you say that yeah the throat chakra vishuddha chakra sixteen petal notice\n07:17 - then is the dwadash parna patma chakra naval chakra is the is the manipur chakra the shape then is the shasta parna padma at the genitals at the back in the spine\n07:32 - and then there's the chatur parana padma which is muladhar chakra muladhara swadhishtan manipur anhad vishuddha adnan these are the chakras right this is how\n07:43 - a teacher would explain to you what i do the way the way i explain it is like this i tell the guys don't bother about the chakras\n07:56 - just go and do your sadhana man open your account get in don't read the book jump into the water and start swimming of course it's\n08:07 - shallow water it's not it's not deep water so when you start swimming later i can teach you the techniques by experience you will get the techniques\n08:16 - so i said do the sadhana first don't bother about the chakras by virtue of practice your mind and body shall clarify and you should be able to see the astral\n08:27 - chakras by virtue of practice that's how a master teaches i'm not saying i'm a teacher or a master but i heard that but i teach like that i said let it come\n08:37 - by firsthand experience but still the intellect intellectual change that's also good guidance there are two ways of teaching so don't worry\n08:50 - either of the ways you can adopt don't get stuck in locating the chakras and all just do your sadhana you will feel the vibration there automatically next question",

          "transcript": "00:01 - i enjoy the positive emotions now the thing is when the negative emotion comes def that definitely disturbs and disturbs my work so of course i have observed many type\n00:13 - of meditations and all some mechanisms must have reduced whether this yoga what your teaching or what you are giving can i burn totally all negative emotions\n00:22 - like whatever if which is in me can you support in that direction so you want to get rid of all your all negative negative emotions yes it will there are two factors in this my\n00:36 - first the answer to you is yes you can yes you can firstly it will depend upon the regularity of your\n00:45 - purushartha on your effort your regular effort you see the second is your karma some people have bad karma some have good karma it's just newton's third law of motion\n01:01 - every action has an equal and opposite reaction so it depends on how many many traumas or many reactions you have created which are negative from your past\n01:11 - and this life which have coalesced in your collective subconscious kriya yoga is a method of churning out this negativity and spewing out all\n01:24 - the negative unconscious thoughts all the toxins of the body so for this you definitely have to do sata now what happens in some cases that when\n01:36 - a person starts he gets so much of negativity coming up bubbling up that he said holy papri i was better off when i didn't do kriya it's going so bad i'm feeling so\n01:47 - depressed that's the test where you should not stop if you carry on and overcome that of course you need a little you can stop for a few days and\n01:56 - carry on if you overcome that then you are a victor then you will defeat all your negative emotions\n02:05 - a human being is a human being you see like we say there's ups and downs in everybody's lives take it like a man and i think that kriya yoga tends to\n02:18 - positivity and i think yes it's a question of time two people came to me and they said can i get rid of negativity one one fellow came and he got rid of\n02:29 - negativity within the first 20 days the next fellow took three months and the third trap got it done after two and a half years\n02:38 - so they said why this difference i said it's like kriya yoga is like cleaning off the lamp glass we have a kandeel a lantern the kandinga suit in it so if the suit\n02:50 - is thick it takes more time to show the flame of positive life and if the suit is less kriya yoga cleans it quicker but the cleaning is still going on\n03:01 - so kriya yoga is a process of cleaning the lamp glass of your body and mind and so do not be discouraged it must work it has to work you you know like i used\n03:13 - to read when a smaller person he projected as prawn and other people are breathing through his breath we read some things about of abhinav gupta where he said one of the highest\n03:22 - initiations is to breathe through the breathing of the disciple which i gave you so i said is this to be given to the common public but who knows whether they\n03:33 - are the common public they may be advanced souls of a past life they've already done it so when you give this when you release the prana kriya yoga practice can make\n03:43 - you do that and it will get you on the positive upside it is a lightning path so all your karmas are going to come down upon you\n03:52 - you have to be brave what's the next question uh guruji would you give initiations and mantra diksha individually when i give an issue mantra individually\n04:07 - yes the initiation consists of a very powerful mantra itself the the initiation consists of a mantra and mantra is that which comes from the\n04:19 - mind and its ripples steady the mind it mantra comes from the heart this ripple studies the mind so kriya yoga itself is a great\n04:28 - maha mantra yes i want to meditate from tomorrow what do i do i mean you said you should nobody can meditate sit for meditation or something listen nobody can meditate\n04:41 - meditation happens as a result of sadhana what is sadhana kriya yoga sadhana sadhana is the practice of spiritual growth right it is the practice of you practice\n04:59 - your toil you till the soil you put many you put in alfonso mango tree you can't you can't say i'm mangoing you can't you have to do the sadhana first he said can i sit for mango ah\n05:12 - mango will happen if you do the mana if you do sadhana if you do the practice of spiritual growth which is tilling the soil giving the miniature\n05:20 - mango will happen as a result of your practice of spiritual growth in the west they have a very less concept of what is sadhana yeah so sadhana is a continuous\n05:34 - process of self-discipline evolutionary action sadhna is sata bhas and satya tabias produces varagya so the fruit of varangi will come\n05:50 - through the repetitive practice of kriya yoga it must be continuous and it must be repetitive and kriya yoga has that because\n06:02 - kriya yoga is not for the lazy and if you breathe continuously the laziness will also go so kriya yoga is a process of spinal breathing it evolves your consciousness it pierces\n06:13 - the knots in your spine which is called the shadow chakra it is a very advanced sadhana which the himalayan great masters have made simple\n06:22 - for the grahastha to practice it is for householders to practice kriya sanjivani sadhana and you can conquer and overcome death like yogis\n06:47 - and then there comes a time when you can say oh death where is thy sting oh grave where is thy victory so kriya yogas i mean whatever i say of\n07:04 - kriya yoga is less and that's why it necessitated me to give you the experience to show you the difference i'm not saying i'm inferior to others\n07:12 - i'm not saying i'm superior i'm just saying i'm one of the few people who has given you the experience of kriya yoga already given you anugraha on kriyayog without you asking for it so\n07:21 - easily because my bhandar is full my bandar is babaji i've got zillions of dollars billions of nil arabic went and said in the west he said had\n08:05 - india no other gift to offer to the world kriya yoga and rajya would itself suffice as a kingly offering this is the words of gyanothar\n08:18 - so this is very good and i hope you people take the most of advantage i promise you the second watch if i'm in america and you call me and say gurunath there are 40 people sitting in a circle\n08:28 -

          "transcript": "00:04 - I this you see one of the main uh factors about healing is to give people a lot of space our camps the satsangs here are very intense when I do\n00:19 - it I do it very intense with you meditation and then you have a lot of free space in the afternoon to fly around you know and then again we come and we sharpen and become intense till\n00:29 - the time you sleep your mind is very focal thinking on the blue light of God before you don't Fritter away the energies of your mind don't waste them for they are\n00:42 - precious and I tell you do not be disappointed sometimes you try to meditate and chant om namash Shay but everything else but the thought\n00:58 - of om namash comes in your mind mind you're thrown about how many have had this uh this experience that in spite of you trying to meditate your thoughts other thoughts which you do not want\n01:10 - sweep you aside how many have had this so all of you are sincere meditators those who have not had this they are telling a lie don't believe them and don't keep their company\n01:23 - because they're too perfect so a person who sits on a horse is bound to fall if you're learning how to ride you're bound to get injured if you're learning\n01:34 - how to meditate you're bound to come across these difficulties these are the scars of an old Warrior which shows that you've been trying through thick and thin and I tell\n01:47 - people the worse the meditation the more the rejoicing you should have rejoice and if that if that's what I'm saying then you'll tell me oh gurunath that means we should Rejoice every day\n02:01 - because every meditation gets screwed up at some point or the other but this is bound to happen because you are swimming Upstream you know there's only a handful\n02:14 - of people in America who are practicing the in-depth meditation there's only a handful of you one in 10 million who is practicing this in-depth\n02:29 - meditation and therefore you're bound to come across these difficulties but the good news is this if you're\n02:38 - meditating you're trying to do the J of om namash shivay and while you're doing the OM namash shiv a picture of the Goddess Saraswati\n02:58 - comes now you don't she's also also goddess she's also Divine but still for the subtler and higher meditation you should only meditate on the subject of your\n03:10 - focus your mind substance should gel and somehow try as we may the American word is we cannot gel the Mind gel is the word right gel means when it's a liquid\n03:26 - before you form jelly it's all like liquid when you put it in the fridge or whatever then it comes you can it comes like a slice it's jelled so we got to yoga is in American language yoga is the\n03:39 - practice to gel the mind and if your mind can gel on only on Shiva and nothing else only on Shiva this is Shiva yes\n03:57 - Parvati very correct proportion Shiva is not nothing Parvati is everything she is creating the galaxies in a regular sequence just bailing them out like this you\n04:10 - know as they making diali sweets you know just making lus and just throwing them out into the but then when you're focusing on him suddenly you focus on her then you\n04:23 - focus on the galaxies then you say oh which one could be my Milky Way galaxy this is the Andromeda this is the Milky Way and in the Milky Way galaxy how small you are then your thoughts get\n04:34 - distracted step by step and then you've seen you've gone far away from Shiva because then you've located your little solar system your planet your house in the Bay Area house in San Francisco and\n04:46 - la and then in your house is your little dog you say oops where have I gone from Shiva to my little dog I've gone from Shiva to my little dog what's the name of your dogs say it\n04:57 - all at once say the name of your dogs some niran bakti bti shaki samadi niran Puja has everybody come\n05:43 - no you keep noting those the thing down right d in the thing y also got it here you see what I'm trying to tell you is that when you go to Advanced meditation when you try to bind your mind\n05:58 - substance on a particular object when what is concentration concentration is binding your mind substance upon a single object and the mind wanders\n06:17 - again and is brought back to the single object it wanders again and is brought back to the single object this is called the effort of concentration to bring your mind back again and again and bind\n06:32 - it to the single object of your meditation is this description simple enough you want me to simplify it more I who cannot understand this to whom is this description new\n06:48 - raise your hands specific I've not heard it it's new to me myself so I would raise my hands because concentration is usually defined as concentration is the fact fa of\n07:01 - exclusive attention who has heard of this raise your hands this is concentration but this you have not heard of that concentration is binding the whole of your mind substance upon a\n07:14 - single object and bringing it back again and again to that object each time it gets distracted this is very deep and you've not heard of this right because you do not know that\n07:27 - mind okay only one God I knows it mind substance mind substance is a vast ocean your mind your mind is like the storm like the hurrian\n07:45 - Katrina it's not organized it's not jelled your mind is like the Hurrican Katrina no mind is organized or jel that's why we have what is called satsang sitting in the company of a\n07:59 - master where he sits and you're looking at him you have a connection with the master and empathy a Unity with the master and when you look him eye to eye\n08:10 - and he goes into still Consciousness and your mind Stills with his mind your mind Stills into his Consciousness so in 1 minute in a fraction of a second he's done with you\n08:27 - years of practice which you cannot get with years of practice you get in a Flash I [Music] I now when you practice\n08:39 - concentration concentration is not only focusing your mind on one object concentration includes your mind wandering from that object and the effort to bring it back to the focal\n08:56 - point of your concentration this is what you have not heard heard and known I this is never told to you by your teachers firstly in Western education they don't tell you what is\n09:08 - concentration they just say come here pay attention pay attention they just say that right that's what you know by concentration then you know that\n09:20 - concentration is focusing on a single object but that is not concentration alone concentration is the bringing the Mind back bringing the wandering mind back back again and again and again like\n09:34 - a trot child bringing it back to the object of your attention when the mind is totally not wandering and is on the object of attention it is Flowing effortlessly\n09:48 - that is called meditation is the is the is the distinction clear to you even I thought concentration was when the Mind flows on a single object\n10:00 - object without distraction so meditation is a deeper concentration",

message now is that we are late for world peace there have been many explosions of hatred words race distinctions apartheid we have to keep up with that and create an implosion of\n02:45 - peace and love how maybe to do this this may be done by connecting each one of us with a common factor like breath or awareness or prana so first I am going to connect all of us with pran and then\n02:59 -

relaxed being the let go let go let go let go let go of the mind all the Masters and ages down the ages all the Masters have said interference of mind negates the inflow of higher\n04:58 - knowledge so if you want true gnosis definitely use the mind study for three hours six hours 10 hours 12 hours use the mind use it but when you are going in for the experience the mind is a\n05:13 - stumbling block you should sit with love intuitive feeling nacelles so my humble request to all of you is drop the mind open the heart and become five the more you become 5 like you as you're\n05:35 - a child or five that is the condition that is the gateway through which I can enter and give you the experience if you don't become 5 if you don't drop your mind and open your heart of awareness if\n05:46 - you sit with an attitude and judgmental mind can't happen I'm sorry that is the block so remove your judgmental mind and attitude sit with an unbiased awareness sit with love what cause withholds you\n06:07 - to smile the Sun rises in time the sky is blue the whole universe is in harmony and why do our little grumpy selves want to have attitude who the hell are we on this earth I mean how much do we count\n06:21 -

          "transcript": "00:02 - [Music] very calm and peaceful this alchy it&#39;s a very ancient SI and\n00:29 - this this is a gold leaf this is if I put this on this after some time the Mercury will eat up the gold it&#39;s a it&#39;s a very high quality\n00:48 - rejuvenating food and the gold leaf as you see is this is the gold gold leaf and you put the gold leaf on the mercur you see it&#39;s very\n01:13 - thin it is pure gold yeah know pure gold and then you put this on this gold is rubbed into it&#39;s rubbed into the Mercury and the Mercury devours the gold it is food\n01:31 - it&#39;s it&#39;s an Alchemy yes if I if I put in so much amount of gold equal weight of mercury then the Mercury will produce\n01:46 - gold this is alchemy this is not chemistry it&#39;s Alchemy so Alchemy has always been a mystery in the whole of Europe amongst the uh the French and the Romans and the\n01:58 - Italians and see it is has eaten the gold it immediately you can&#39;t see the gold now it&#39;s absorbed it has absorbed the gold it&#39;s still open it&#39;s absorbed the did you see that how this absorb the\n02:16 - gold it is just not there incredible so applying the I did so this is a all the Alchemists the yogis were Alchemists of the past and they knew the\n02:35 - secret of uh consolidating Mercury and using it not exact of course in extreme cases to to elongate their lives but in normal cases just for good health and they normally wore it\n02:51 - around their necks and they touch their body and they kept it and when they needed it whenever they were hungry and they were in the jungle there was no food we just take water dip it in the\n03:07 - water and drink it it is a it&#39;s called The Elixir of life also and in the Western Europe all the French and the Germans they called this the philosopher stone in Germany and in Switzerland we\n03:21 - may have a name for this it&#39;s called a Quicks silver quick quick silver so the the consolidation of Quick Silver there are yogis in the gwal region of Himalayas who still consolidate these\n03:32 - tablets and give it to people and even disorders like uh cancer AIDS schizophrenia have all been cured by a monitored dosage of uh of the rasendra this is the\n03:52 - rasendra so so we have to keep feeding this with gold [Music] SC you&#39;re lucky to have to have seen\n04:15 - this they don&#39;t usually show it so here it is now I&#39;m bit gentle with it I don&#39;t I when I put it for my meditation and try just keep it like this and it you can see it going you can\n04:34 - see it after some time let us see without doing anything if it eats it it will eat its equal quantity of gold this is a gold leaf which I put on it and now it&#39;s absorbing the gold this is alchemy\n04:48 - it strengthens the purity of the Mercury gold strengthens the purity of the Mercury it&#39;s a different science than chemistry you know it is a lost science and we are trying to revive this science\n04:59 - which which it will be and it&#39;s very necessary for the Cure of various maladies with which humanity is betet this is my belief since I have had experience of\n05:16 - this is meant to assist you in your meditation it Stills the mind because the mind is like Quicksilver you try to catch it and you cannot catch it so the quick silver depicts the mind of the a\n05:26 - normal human being it&#39;s running here and there a yogi who Masters his mind is depicting the still quick silver that when a yogi is Quick Silver he has mastered his mind like you are\n05:39 - there and I still you connect with me and your mind is still and if the person who&#39;s photographing if they tune in to me\n05:57 - through the lens them their thoughts will also disappear there and when I increase concentration it&#39;s it gets absorbed it&#39;s all a question of concentration and this the\n06:12 - subtle mechanics of the mind and the subtle mechanics of the soul that you first in order to do anything with your mind you must have it absolutely still without a thought no thought you connect\n06:24 - with me there you&#39;re still right so it&#39;s the connectivity with which uh between two people and this is the nect effect which it\n06:42 - gives this it&#39;s just a connection it&#39;s tuning in so a yogi who can control his mind can still quick silver the moment uh the uh the quick silver is turned into still silver its poisonous\n06:58 - qualities are transformed into netive in qualities and neine I I have seen yogis in the Himalayas who have lived for a very very long time and are doing work in the world today they&#39;re serving\n07:10 - Humanity this we arey I&#39;m trying to do this in my own good time it&#39;s a very big shling to handle and it requires a lot of concentration and a lot of power to you know do this we do transmit Earth\n07:23 - peace through self peace and we use the shivling as a facilitator and it amplifies the healing process we use it as a as an assistant uh this thing and it is of course by\n07:38 - Lord shiva&#39;s Grace that it happens we honor and respect it and what is the range do you have to be next to the Shing to to feel the the impulses giving off I&#39;ll tell you an experience of a\n07:51 - person who went to London uh and we were giving a transmission he said gurunath I saw something I saw water and I saw a big silver now he didn&#39;t know it was Mercury\n08:02 - a big silver shieling and there was wood around it he said it in London wow so it was contacting there he has never come to India then I showed him the picture I said is is it this the temple picture\n08:14 - with the wooden uh stuff and I showed it to him and he said yes this is exactly what I contacted and I felt the healing so it heals all over the the whole planet whoever Tunes in or adjust to\n08:29 - that uh that healing happens but the spirit is see now it is it will be D for a Time [Music]\n08:40 - Kal with a golden tin so the spirit will have to be infused by the presiding Yogi of the asham and he will have to infuse his spirit in the center of the shivling because I sit\n08:54 - down the shling is up and if you go up you will notice a connection with me over there and see me it is a real thing uh the shling is retaining your um your transmission the transmission\n09:11 - and the spirit of the the informing Spirit of the master of the that place if there is a master and is a true Master you should be able to do this is this uh hold it is it a special quality\n09:22 - of mercury to be to retain the spiritual transmission yes yes and uh to transmit if you&#39;re doing an earth peace through self peace it will transmit peace it&#39;s a symbol of Earth peace and\n09:36 - that&#39;s why I&#39;ve had this up in service to humanity of course we have had testimonials to that that they have received these transmissions and people who have not known us at all who&#39;ve\n09:46 - never seen the shivling also and therefore I pray that this be of some service to humanity as a symbol of Earth peace through self peace the shivling with which is\n10:05 - there mercur is only an aspect of the sheling it&#39;s much more than uh uh Mercury it&#39;s the central essence of the spiritual Sun so these\n10:23 - are AIDS to get you to that state of peaceful consciousness [Music] for",

          "transcript": "00:35 - so we used to go to the synagogue I went to the church and I prayed and every time before means we used to say Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name for thy kingdom come we used to\n00:47 - say this and then we say for what we are about to receive may the Lord make us truly thankful for Christ's sake you know that how do you know that you sing the same Grace as us used to say belong\n00:58 - to my religion used to say my boarding school oh boarding school which boarding school is this in Switzerland oh mine Switzerland and I was in in India and Nal and they said the same Grace good\n01:10 - uniformity which we trying to get so we used to say this grace and we became very holy and Pious but the moment my I was very holy in my\n01:24 - thoughts indeed I was something else because every time at the end of the the session uh we used to invite the girls school to come and we had to show our Best\n01:36 - Manners now opposite me was a greedy girl so we had to offer the plates of cakes to them so what I did is I I put my thumb on the cake I liked and out now that girl she was very strong\n01:53 - she put her hand in that cake and she was struggling with that for me and it was a lot of hard feelings and then ultimately she took half and I took half so the next year the girls came we were\n02:04 - invited them for this thing for what we are about to receive immediately as I said that I saw they all us good Christians we had our eyes closed and I in in thought I was very\n02:20 - pure but indeed I was what I was so for what we are about to receive I stretched out took the morang I like the morang put it out M Lord Mak us truly that so in in thought we are something indeed\n02:37 - we are something it's very very important once a Christian Missionary visited India to convert the Pagan Indians into\n02:56 - Christianity he was bringing something new so this was Christian religion 2,000 years old Indian religion traces 20,000 years ago anyway he will come to teach something the desire to teach like a\n03:10 - small child teaches his father no Daddy it's not like this it's like this I'll show you put on your specs my grandson tells me if you can't read put on your specs\n03:22 - so the Christian Missionary was like this and he was walking through the jungles he was a holy man and along from the other side came a lion so the Christian Missionary looked\n03:38 - at the lion and said oh love won't do because Jesus taught love so do you all but here he he doubted that love would work and so he was his M mind was racing\n03:55 - to find some other technique or thing which he could do you know to get away from the line he said if I run in two leaps in bounds he's going to catch me and finish me\n04:09 - off then he got an idea he said ah I got an idea stare at the lion so the lion came closer and the priest went closer and he kept his eyes fixed and the lion came along and the priest went\n04:24 - along the priest's footsteps were dragging to a still but he was appeared to be a courageous man and he and then they came face to face and the priest stared at The\n04:38 - Lion and the lion stared at the priest now this was no ordinary lion he was a holy lion and he said his prayers and all his things and of course in India you can\n04:56 - expect such a thing so and he stared at the priest and the priesthood and then the impossible happened the impossible\n05:12 - happened there came a deep Rumble oh and the lion put his hands up like this and the priest said what is he doing priest thought to himself the lion\n05:27 - is praying of course he was praying he was a holy lion and all his thoughts were full of prayer he was a holy\n05:38 - lion his thoughts priest also said I'll do this so the lion said hey what are you doing so he said I'm praying he said what are you doing the lion said I'm saying\n05:50 - [Laughter] grace because it he was a holy lion I'm talking talking about you you are the holy lion you are the holy lion because we go to church we Are Holy We\n06:06 - Are Holy Lions but indeed in thought he was a holy lion but indeed he was a lion he ate up the priest no matter how holy we are in thought when the time comes whether it\n06:26 - be sex whether it be Greed for money and whether it be things our subconscious Drive is so powerful that you'll be W like a wave from behind you'll be taken up in that sex act and\n06:39 - you won't know what you've done and then afterwards you'll regret it it happens so many times over here many women in America they involve\n06:50 - themselves like this then they try to frame the person to make a mop-up operation and say that this guy has molested me so this is the drive which takes them unaware it comes like a wave\n07:00 - from behind and whoosh and you're gone in spite of your prayers and things so what the Alchemy of total transform does is not only in thought but ined by heavy Dynamic breathing it\n07:17 - uproots the animal drive from you and transforms you indeed to what you are this is the basic difference between mental prayer and things of hymns which are are also good because firstly you\n07:31 - have to be holy in the mind and then for it to seep into your Deeds you have to go much deeper how many agree with me on this fact how many agree with me on this fact\n07:43 - that no matter how much of prayers you say or I chant a mantra some unless I do it with the breath it won't seep into my very summon substance my being so I'm transforming myself you\n07:59 - don't only only need to pray you need a dynamic prayer and the dynamic prayer is by laying your life on the line means breathing through the spine KOB transforms you\n08:12 - totally have I been able to make I made this distinction because I'm trying to give you the message that what you've done is good what you've done is good it's time to move\n08:25 - on what you've done is good it's time to move on and if I am saying that humanity is Tied by the selfsame cord of Love through breath then I must be able to breathe\n08:39 - through your breath I I otherwise my saying is an empty bubble right it is not it is not but even if I don't give the experience breath is still the only\n08:58 - prayer so today we are not only going to be holy in our mantras and chanting and our thoughts we would like to be holy indeed and because we want to be holy\n09:15 - indeed we doing the shaki s and Kundalini transmission Enlightenment and you will come one by one and get yourself ready for the initiation\n09:30 - actually in the touch is the initiation the rest is all secondary stuff the teaching is all secondary stuff the touch of the master according to the yogic tradition there are many schools\n09:40 - of yoga many differ where they don't initiate they just keep teaching and one person teaches the other that has no value the seeds will not Sprout I'm sure you've come to me here to listen to the\n09:54 - truth and not to get your ego embed although I give you the balom of the son to protect you against my harsh words but I have no ego bomb I promise you I have no ego bom so only the tough\n10:07 - ones will stay the flighty ones Can Fly Away less work for me cuz I carry all your load and then you expect me to take off as the hamsa Swan with so many guys on my back Lord give me\n10:26 - less so in witness of the fire and the water I shall initiate you into the sacred science of Shakti which is in the west\n10:39 - called sh the sidat healing and Enlightenment techniques and you will come one by one as I give you the touch the third eye",

          "transcript": "00:03 - [2012, Cataclysms, Earth's Destruction, The\nSoul and Cosmic Masters] [Music from \"Wings To Freedom\" Artist: Shivraj,\nused by permission] [Question]\nThere's a lot of trouble on Earth right now especially on the ecosystem level. And I'm just curious as to how you see our\nresponsibility and if humanity will survive.\n00:29 - But the forces of change, of pollution and\nall these kinds of things are really creating trouble for the Earth itself. And in way. I curious how you are seeing all these events\nunfolding in light of the future. [Gurunath's Answer]\nWell, number one the masters don't the see\n01:09 - the outer shell and the physical body, that's\nthe evanescent or impermanent you, they see the soul. Secondly the size of some master are such,\nthat I'm sitting here, and suppose I'm a very colossal being and within me are many worlds\nand solar systems. Have you seen that picture, \"Honey I've Shrunk\nthe Kids?\"\n01:31 - [Laughter] Have you seen that? Okay go to Disney, if you haven't seen that\ngo to Disney and see the other one \"Honey, I've Shrunk the Audience\". When we are all atoms in the body of God. Okay?\n01:50 - You understand? Now if you make it even bigger, these worlds,\nthis planet is so small in the body of God that it's... There are many pollutions taking place in\nyour body also which are like your planet. Then by Kriya Yoga and Pranayam, we lock,\nstock and barrel, breath fresh oxygen and\n02:12 - detox the body. And that's what the great God, the creator\nis doing for us. He's detoxing the system. So there will be billions and billions of\nplanets like our Earth in His body, He's not going to be unduly concerned about it.\n02:27 - Because the Earth is bigger than us we feel\nunduly concerned. For Him the Earth is small, the size of an\natom in His body. So He's just going to do the pranayam. Also so a Master is very big in his consciousness. He will work firstly for the spirit of your\nsoul.\n02:41 - And if your body has to be discarded, it's\nno big deal. You are not the body. The body is just the shell. So aren't we putting pressure on the wrong\nthing? Aren't we having the tail wag the dog instead\nof having the dog wagging the tail?\n02:58 - So first we must focus on the spiritual evolution\nof our consciousness. And then upon the ladybirds, the fishing,\nthe flies, all our outer non-self. The material self is the non-being. Our true self is the soul. We are a soul and have a body.\n03:15 - So we see it as no undue concern. Because these are the material... the spirit of you has to be evolved out of\nthese bodies. There are, this is not the only planet, there\nare other planets which you can go to. So the moon was discarded, so this kind of\nplanet will be discarded as an empty shell,\n03:31 - and we shall go on to a new planet. So the spirit keeps evolving from planet to\nplanet, globe to globe. Community to community, humanity to humanity,\nrace to race, humanity to humanity, globe to globe, planet to planet. So it keeps changing.\n03:48 - And these are minor things on the ecosystem,\nthey can be corrected within a wink of the eye. It's just big mold, it's just the big clay\nof matter. Matter will be crushed into the matrix, the\nmatrica and a new globe will form. So your question was small but if you're asking\nof the Master's consciousness that Consciousness\n04:15 - is so vast that of course, if there's little\nboil on His body, to the inhabitants around the boil, it's a huge volcanic eruption. But for him He doesn't care, He carries on\nwith His work. He puts on a little treatment on it. The boil bursts, then its okay.\n04:30 - A volcanic eruption is just a small pimple\non the body of God. Great masters can take on the karma of humanity\nat one time. The truly great ones. We don't see it as anything undue to worry,\nand if several bodies die or come, I'm talking of philosophy, not of ethics or morality or\ndeary dear or oh my dear and all of that stuff.\n04:60 - I'm talking of how the vast vision sees it. How would God see our creation which is zillion,\nbillions of light years across. Eternities across which is huge, huge, huge\nbeyond our compassion. He'd see it as a little bubble of nothingness. When a Yogi goes into Samadhi he says, \"Oh\nlord.\n05:30 - Existence a bubble in my consciousness, my\nconsciousness, a nothing in Thy nothingness.\" So God is very vast. To ask how a master, or the great Manus, the\ngreat Krishnas or the Christ's see this from their sphere on high, they would see it as\nevolving the spirit. First, we are concerned with the evolution\nof you and not your paraphernalia.\n05:60 - And by your paraphernalia I mean your beautiful\nhair, your lipstick, your nose and alignment, your figure, your physical body. Your idol worship of the \"not-you\". The masters are not concerned about the apparent\nself which is your body and mind. They're concerned about you, who is the spirit,\nthe immortal spirit.\n06:28 - And that's what they're tried to get out of\nthe trammels of your physical bodies and your senses. I'm spirit, I'm truth, I'm love divine this\nbody mind, a dream of mine. So we have to change the gestalt, we have\nto paradigm shift. We have it wrong here.\n06:46 - Shift your consciousness from the evanescent\nbody which is dying in 80 years to the immortal soul.' And first make up you minds, are you an immortal,\nincorruptible soul or are you a perishable body. We have been hypnotized since birth into thinking\nwe are a perishable body and not an immortal\n07:04 - soul. And then we put the hands of ignorance, the\nhands of our minds upon the hands of our soul and cry we cannot see. Take away the hands of your mind away from\nthe eyes of your soul and behold the moon of your delight.\n07:18 - You are the son of God immortal, free and\neternal. And not disease, decay and dying. Your destiny is far more glorious than what\nyou think. A little oil spill, a little tsunami, or an\nearthquake or tilting of the axis can do nothing to you.\n07:36 - And the great ones have saved you before and\nthey shall save you again. Like Noah put into the ark two of its kind,\neveryone of them at the great cataclysm. And that's why you are here, because every\nspecie was saved. And so again the savior will come and save\nyou. The Noah will save you and the Christ will\nsave you.\n07:58 - So He does not look at it from the point of\nview of the physical body. Or it's not a prize winning contest. You know, that he who has the best figure\nis going to win the prize and go first to God. He who has the curved line is the most, closest\nto God - it's nothing to do with your physical\n08:21 - body. It's with your immortal soul. The permanent you. I'm not this house of flesh and bones which\nsleeps, decays and dies, I'm immortal consciousness, Lord of the Earth and Skies.\n08:32 - So once you practice this saying, shift your\nconsciousness from the body of disease, decay and death to the soul of immortal life and\nlove and truth. That's what Yoga is about, that's what Kriya\nYoga is about. Let this be firmly fixed in your mind and\nevery time before going to bed say ten times, I'm spirit, I'm truth - I'm light, I'm truth,\nI'm love divine, this body mind's a dream\n08:59 - of mine. I'm light, I'm truth, I'm love divine, the\nbody mind a dream of mine. I'm light, I'm truth, I'm love divine. I'm light, I'm truth, I'm love divine. I'm spirit, I'm truth, I'm love divine.\n09:11 - I'm spirit, I'm truth, I'm love divine. Then Gurunath will come and say okay we've\nmade shift and then you'll float in your spirit and imagine your body of flesh lying separate\nfrom you. But always persist: I'm light, I'm truth,\nI'm love divine, this body's but a dream of mine.\n09:28 - I'm light, I'm truth, I'm love divine, this\nbody's but a dream of mine. [snore sound] Aww. Come back again. Try again. Try again.\n09:37 - Do it tonight. That's your homework. Go ahead and God bless and God speed.",

          "transcript": "00:08 - h n don't be before also exactly in time so now in the evening time I'm going to give you the K yoga I'm going to initiate you\n00:35 - and Empower you into the sacred science of PR upon y it is offering the inhaling into the exhaling breath and the exhaled into the inhaled breath it is called the pran upon\n00:48 - Yad okay the sacred this is what you are practicing the Yogi the true internal Yogi does not do home hav and Puja that the guruji does the the pujari the priest but what\n01:09 - the yogi does the gurunath the the yogi he does the fire ceremony within his own spine it is the sacred fire right of the Yogi the Kaa yog is called the sacred fire right of the Yogi so this sacred\n01:29 - fire is is called the pran upon Yad so the two oblations which are offered into the sacred fire of the self is PR and upon these two currents ignite the spirit of the\n01:47 - Soul so it is so scientific after the Omar Kaa we do what is called the Shiva Shakti Kaa\n02:10 - this is called the K yog Kundalini K yog goes by the name of sha Shakti and also by the name of PR y now relax stretch your feet out\n02:46 - relax any questions for me personally if I don't do anything in life and I just do this I am content because I know nothing is more important than breathing God of\n03:10 - course all of the things are important I'm not saying so taking your children to school you know having a job making\n03:24 - money having a lot of friends these are very important things but are secondary importance to God first you have to breathe right if you don't breathe then how will you get a\n03:37 - job right I didn't see a non-breathing man doing a job or a non-breathing man having a baby or raising a family without breath\n03:50 - right you have to breathe but if you're breathing in any case this is my thinking my logic if you're breathing in any case why not breathe\n04:05 - for God I mean in any case everybody's mind is a whole BS so why not purify that BS and breathe for God purify your detox your body and rejuvenate it detox it and\n04:20 - rejuvenate it and first charity begins at home make your body full of happiness and joy and peace and then overflow and give it to others that's what I'm giving right that's what you must\n04:35 - do so in any case you're breathing why not breathe for God when you breathe for God you've done the main work you've done the main homework of your karma for the\n04:46 - day then you can do what you like then I don't care but this is very simple logic how do you find it do you find it good simple it doesn't strain your brains\n05:00 - you're breathing in any case no Madam then why not breathe for God I'm breathing in any case why don't I breathe for the devil maybe some fellows think like\n05:16 - that we don't force anyone even in spirituality there's a democracy of common sense you can do what you like I'm telling you what I like and since you like what I like\n05:31 - you've come here and you can feel the effect of a profound peace right so therefore once you breathe for God once you do the Shiva Shakti\n05:47 - Kaa and evolve Consciousness and you breathe for God then all of the things fall into place secondary things of secondary importance in their given priorities and and these given\n06:02 - priorities are different from person to person it's their choice you know but first hold god with your breath climb The Stairway to Heaven breathing for\n06:18 - God and as you keep breathing you become one with God you become more and more Godlike right and less and less demon\n06:32 - likee God gave us a choice he planted within us himself and also a demon and he said now man you are called\n06:45 - man the word man comes from the Sanskrit word man Manus means The Thinker think and see who you want to choose so there was a in in a in the German uh uh stories there's a fellow\n07:05 - called fa and this fa he thought and he made his choice he sold his soul to the devil right so that was his choice and whatever the consequences\n07:22 - were he bore those consequences were I hope and pray to God that f is out of the clutches of the devil now and he is now choosing God you have to make your\n07:35 - choice but in order to make your choice if you are aware of your breath your innermost being the core of your innermost being will lead you to God the only\n07:48 - Advantage is that when you before you make your choice the Devil comes first with all his goodies and ways money wealth name Fame you know beautiful men beautiful woman attracted on anything to\n08:00 - distract you from the Stillness and God with his stall he stands way back so by the time you reach God and your journey you've already been wed and distracted in life\n08:14 - totally and why God has made it like this I didn't know but now I know the answer and I'm going to tell you it's not God who made it difficult it's you by your own Karma Life After\n08:34 - Life who made it difficult because you enjoyed the wealth you enjoyed the money in your past life you enjoyed the wealth in your past life you enjoyed material benefits luxuries\n08:47 - in your past life giving very little attention to yourself you give more attention to your physical body and your mind which are your not self you give more attention to your apparent self\n09:00 - than your true self and the greatest healing I tell you is healing your apparent self of the ignorance of your true self now who is your apparent self and\n09:15 - who is your true self your apparent self is your physical body your emotions and your fety mind the bedum of thoughts in your mind this is your apparent self but it distracts\n09:30 - you so much that you mistake the cause for the the effect for the cause or the cause for the effect they interchanged the main cause is the soul the Consciousness is you but due to your\n09:42 - thoughts running ha you think you are the thoughts and not the Consciousness you think your body and not Soul you think you're the mind and not the soul so to reverse this to dehypnotize\n09:53 - yourself you must do the constant breathing of Kaa yog which gradually clarifies your mind mind subsides your thoughts and then you can choose between spirit that is Divinity and matter you\n10:08 - can choose between gravity and mass do you understand once you do this and you established in yourself you'll be a happy man all the days of your life when\n10:25 - I went through difficult times taking on the karma of other people or even certain things of my own the people who I meet their karma their baggage is\n10:35 - heavy so I'm usually carrying a heavy baggage that's your baggage I used to say so what if the day is tough and things are difficult as long as I've done my Crea yog my\n10:55 - breathing God I'm happy all the rest is a dream dream it's a test of God I say the whole world and its difficulties Joys and Sorrows are a dream the Eternal peace that pass all understanding the\n11:12 - incomprehensible sweetness sweetness of that nothingness that's it that is my Haven and my home\n11:23 - right when you meet a master or sadguru and when he talks you get a feeling inside of suddenly there's a there's a spot of Peace which hits you say I've reached home this is what I\n11:37 - wanted and if you connect with the master like that that he is my home or he is my innermost being then that is your sguru but you feel that I have drunk now my thirst is quenched forever\n11:50 - I've got what I wanted this is it I reached home right you get that feeling many times right but you don't get it with all Masters so\n12:03 - that's another way to test whether this is your sguru and your master whether he is your parent Source your Haven and your home Guru is your Haven and your\n12:28 - home and in your journey in this world you may lose your possessions your name your wealth your Fame but don't lose God don't forget to consciously breathe\n12:59 - God God this is the secret of Secrets I tell you the secret behind the secret is not to lose God breathe God say oh Lord with every breath I'm creating you within\n13:17 - me",

          "transcript": "00:01 - how do we get through or overcome those little blocks where sometimes we think in our past lives we may have done something evil or we you know uh\n00:11 - that whether it be like that lady last night with the blood of jesus kind of those different kinds of blocks or any of us we think\n00:22 - that maybe we've done something wrong you know that gets in the way sometimes so those are our little kings of guilt okay\n00:34 - see the guilts in drones or depression or aggression or anxiety these are minor things when you do the shiva shakti when you do 144 every day that those aggressions are funneled into the\n00:47 - washing machine of your spinal cord and they come out clean they're lengthened they're washed and then they're transformed into life the transfiguration takes place do you know\n00:58 - that the practice of shiva shakti which you are doing is a process of transfiguration do you know that you are being transfigured every time you do it but\n01:08 - you're doing so little that you try being transfigured at very little you do 500 every day and in three months see what a transfiguration takes place we won't be able to recognize you\n01:19 - this is the transfiguration this is what jesus meant by the transfiguration by transforming your weaknesses the darkness the negativity into light\n01:31 - power and truth take control of your life and practice this it is the process of transfiguration there is no sin\n01:44 - there is no vice there is no virtue these are all small facets or idiosyncrasies of course if you dwell\n01:56 - on a vice or a guilt syndrome and let it make a home in your mind it could be very damaging therefore we have a meditation called the pratipak\n02:09 - the meditation of opposites he was guilty should feel they are pure and strong constantly you see there is no such thing\n02:20 - as a sin in this world the only sin is the feeling of guilt that follows the action\n02:32 - which you tend which is labeled by society as a spice or a virtue you take up a gun you shoot a man and society says you're a murderer and\n02:45 - you get guilt you take up a gun you shoot a hundred men with the same gun and society says you're a hero a war hero and you feel great and you get the congressional\n02:58 - order of merit i mean what the hell is this same gun same society are they trying to make a fool of us this is stupid\n03:09 - there is no vice no virtue it is the spirit in which it is done if you if you kill for for motives which are selfish they call it a vice\n03:20 - if you kill in order to save the country from being run over by another country it's patriotism but the gun is the same the bullets are the same the life has gone\n03:30 - all the same that person of one or the hundred don't care they in any case go and evolve it's you who are stuck with this sid now why so about you what the hell are you\n03:39 - wasting your time about make an happy ass sheep of wise and virtue seek the truth that's what i say you have good karma you have bad karma\n03:50 - you have good and you have evil these are all things which are relative which admire the yogi makes an ash sheep of both and seeks directly the truth o lord for\n04:02 - you and you alone and on the path as people come by him he touches them blesses them serves them and assists them along the path to reach the final goal which is the\n04:16 - actualization of the essence of their beings so the sin this wise and virtue has been created by the clergy the ecclesiastical order\n04:32 - to leech off on fleece of money from an innocent society who has not a notion of what has happened because if there's one boy and he goes out with a girl and then while he's going out with a\n04:46 - girl and dating one girl another girl comes and he sort of goes out with the other girl he feels very guilty that he's cheated out on the other girl\n04:55 - so then he has to go to church and profess to the to the to the the priest in the window uh what his guilt fear and whose uh\n05:06 - what his sin is or vices and that priest is going out with both the girls so now this is how the syndrome this is how the\n05:15 - world goes on so it's a big it's a lovely game it's a beautiful little toy game forget these silly games just seek the truth the night and day o lord i burn for thee\n05:28 - whether my wife loves me i am happy whether she hates me i'm happy for me you know\n05:37 - success and failure name and fame to me amir doll's wedding game in joy and sorrow\n05:49 - light and dark i ever that eternal spark in honor and dishonor to the constant yogi ever knew the graph is straight\n06:03 - there's no this that graph at all it's a straight graph it's dead what happens to the encephalogram when a man dies so you must be\n06:20 - play the game of the world as it is be not affected by it just as a lotus in the water lying unwetted and undying\n06:32 - impassioned it's not wetted by the waters it's lying in the waters of sansar of the rasmut as of life it is in society but yet not of society it is not vetted by the waters of\n06:47 - society being as a lotus line in the water lying unwetted yet undying it's not tainted by society yet it's in society be like the light\n07:01 - okay if you tell the light um [Music] the light will still be the light\n07:12 - may not be not purified by it or you see some good things oh beautiful light how beautiful you are in your rays you shine upon me thank you very much i am their humble friend and their servant\n07:24 - nothing will happen to the life nothing light will remain the light you tell the light god dance another the light is not going to get\n07:38 - and he tainted any difference to the light you read oh lord thou art my beloved heart and soul\n07:49 - i breathe thy breath and ye though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i should fear no evil o lord for thou art with me my cup shall be full and i\n07:58 - shall follow thee all the ways of my life amen amen amen in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost the pure holy host\n08:07 - you'll read this okay you read the bible you pick up another book the light has not been affected by the bible and as he put his arms around her\n08:23 - he felt his strong grip and she felt a warm glow rushing through her body as he embraced her to his uh in his manly arms\n08:35 - and he put his lips lips on her lotus-like lips and he kissed her so now this is something to do with a very very beautiful emotion of man and woman and all the light is\n08:48 - still not affected by it another guy comes he says okay wear the passports he says okay fajit he cheats the signature he's fudging passport another fellow is\n08:58 - writing a false check it's all because of the light the light is not purified nor tainted by the actions of the people who do it here but if you put off the lights none of these\n09:08 - things can be done that is the nature of your soul that is the nature of god that is the nature of atma it is neither tainted by the bad nor purified by the good but the\n09:19 - light is the light but if the light is not neither can you do the bad nor the good so you are the light have no guilt have no fear because you cannot have guilt there is no voice no virtue you\n09:31 - the light your soul is not contained by the actions of your emotions or your mental body or your emotional body but if the light is not you cannot forge a check neither can you read the bible\n09:43 - so the atma the divine spirit is above wise and virtue good and evil so you are the light so in the chamber the divine light that fills in the chamber of the hamsa swan\n09:57 - and the cave is your divine soul so have no fear nor guilt this is what must be taught to children today who are suffering under guilt and anxiety and aggression\n10:08 - that there is no sin the sin itself is not a sin but the guilt that follows it is a sin first wash away the guilt you are pure from moment to moment arise or soldiers\n10:19 - of divine and race to your home sublime so this is the confidence we must teach children purity and courage i'm not trying to tell them you've sinned you've\n10:29 - done this already messing up the stuff you know doodoo's lying in a place you come and mix up mess up the whole thing and make a bigger mess you know so don't do that\n10:40 - give them courage give them light and explain to them that the atma is immortal",

life energy control it dissolves the Karma which are latent in the pranic lotuses of your spine so your destiny is in your spine your destiny is in your spine you don't expect me to get more\n00:28 - specific than this do you I is that specific enough for you so therefore does it give you something to strive for because the only purpose of man sergeant on this earth is to seek God but the\n00:44 - question is it is so slow if I'm running I will get there no doubt I will get there even if I start walking from here to Santa Clara definitely I'll get there but if I take a guard I will get there\n01:12 - faster so this is the Lightning path people of evil hearts cannot wait to see their beloved who's they beloved his God and he is camouflaged behind the smile of your loving girlfriend he is\n01:25 - camouflaged between the beautiful red Ferrari that you own and they are very possessive and there it's good here in America I saw a guy with the Ferrari and at the back number plate it was written\n01:38 - she's red she's hot and she is mine you want to totally possess that God and it's okay to ask him base yogurt around he said it doesn't matter as this thing would you touch a sponsor ah don't touch\n01:55 - the car so that's his new girlfriend that's okay but it is God which is giving him the joy behind the Ferrari it's God which is giving you the joy behind the loving arms of your husband\n02:10 - it's God that is behind giving you the joy of the food that your wife cooks for you everything behind every good action is God but you get deluded you get deluded into these minor things and\n02:23 - forget the goal they try to learn and all tried to bring the technique of Hajduk on poverty from this thing I had a talk with Eric on comedy I told him this Vienna dog is one of the track\n02:34 - instead of teaching preaching divinity in preached immortality immortality is a byproduct of divinity not immortality for itself and also the naturalism the sickness of the Himalayas\n02:44 - do not do body immortality for the sake of immortality they keep a fine body the rainbow body full of light free from the ravages of time not because they want to divine body of rainbow light free from\n02:59 - the ravages of time because but because they want such a body so that in a healthy body temple they can house a healthy God that more of the divinity will come into them so divinity God the\n03:14 - divine consciousness itself is the sole purpose of yours sajin on this earth not the yogic beauty spa of body immortality that's the spa and you go to the yogic spa you're else your cells were stopped\n03:29 - you know degenerating they will stop but that really happened don't focus on that will happen by virtue of your yearning for God it takes a long time if I go from here to Santa Clara\n03:43 - walking go to San Francisco it will take me some days Fred Garlits it's faster if I go by the speed of light you know if I travel at the speed of light it would take me eight\n04:03 - minutes from here to the Sun gave me three a few seconds from here to the moon it's faster but if I have to cross the universe if I have to cross the universe with the speed of light then\n04:20 - ten million hundred million 100 million light years and ten billion that is the galaxy not the universe a universe they if I cross the galaxy then it will take 100 men 100 million years 100 million\n04:37 - light years but if I cross the galaxy 500 times five million times just be delighted to take two or three months if I travel at 70 billion times the speed of light it would take me two and a half\n04:55 - to three months to cross the whole universe so this is the expanse but what happens in meditation light space and time becomes gravitationally it becomes the Gurudwara the gravity of the inner\n05:14 - knowing of God and God has no time he has centers everywhere the circumference is nowhere he is boundless that is the person about whom we are talking about who we are searching of\n05:30 - course you know I cannot tell you who the essence of and I can only tell you the pointers can tell you about you how you can get to the being about whom not may be said so I'm talking about\n05:42 - everything but that being about whom he said but still it just so encouraging it points the direction it gives you the way it shows you the light what does the Gerudo is the lighthouse is the\n05:53 - Navigator he shows you the light takes you avoiding the pitfalls which he has been through which you don't have to go through therefore it's necessary for a master to guide the disciple along the\n06:04 - path hi now it takes a million million years to express cosmic consciousness which is also called the Krishna consciousness this is all self realization just to be between Oh God\n06:29 - realization it's also called the Christ consciousness it is called the North Mandela that's connected with us the North Wonder or the Buddha field so to\n06:42 - get to the buddhafield to get to your beloved Krishna or your Christ or your divine goddess whoever you would not like to practice for a million million years it's too\n06:53 - long for the brain cells to express phasma consciousness Kriya yoga body spray Yoga is the lightning path it is the lightning path which makes you speed up your evolution and I'm giving an\n07:09 - approximation if you do 144 of the Kriya you will you will reach in a certain time if you do it faster if you do 10 to 16 hours 18 hours a day you so you get carded\n07:21 - three years if you notice eight to ten hours a day it will take you six years if you do about six to eight hours a day it'll take it'll take you about 12 years and if you if you do two hours to three\n07:35 - hours a day to take you 24 years so two to three hours or two hours is enough that is the group which I'm dealing with here about one to two hours a day which they\n07:45 - can comfortably do without upsetting their day to day program their chores which default their work is called when they go and do some what they say that they say yeah I've got to run my errands\n07:57 - so they could run their errands got a lot of time to run the errands but then who's going to run the errand of God we have got there it is to run also and where do we run a God's errands\n08:11 - we run them in the spinal cord up and down and up and down till the messenger of the air and the air in itself and God become one this is the purpose of running order\n08:26 - Aaron is to become one with the Aaron and the object so this is what Kriya yoga is all about it is called the lightning path also it speeds up the evolution of consciousness I am NOT here\n08:41 - to teach you any religion or cult and not yet to convert you to Islam the Muslim religion neither am i here to make your yoga verse witness or a Hari Krishna or Asha bite or a city yogi I'm\n08:56 - here to tell you about you I am here i am here to tell you about you and therefore i tell you that the community that we form we must all realize that humanity this one's only religion breath\n09:14 - one's only prayer which we will be doing in Kriya yoga and consciousness once only god those who don't want to breathe need not play with us those who don't accept\n09:28 - themselves as human beings need not join our community humanity so it's the its community humanity is very small at the moment in this frame of definition but in truth in fact it is the whole of the\n09:42 - human race we have a following we have a group of like-minded people of fact minded people of six billion 200 million people that's a database warehousing database 6 billion 200 that's the\n09:60 - population of the people on earth and therefore anything less than this would create a cult Christianity Buddhism Hinduism Islam are all colors but Humanity is not a dependent humanity is\n10:19 - the existence of souls on this earth who want to realize the true nature of their being with this I will begin to give you the empowerment the initiation into the poverties Kriya yoga initiation every\n10:41 - time you get it helps your life energy to flow and assists in the expansion of your consciousness it assists in the expansion of your consciousness",

          "transcript": "00:06 - what I would like to do today is the full moon so I'm going to take you out onto the beach we have to be on in the full moon to do this the Earth piece meditation we will do the Earth piece\n00:18 - meditation by the ocean and then we'll come back when I'm working with you when I'm giving you time the spiritual energy that is being\n00:33 - poured forth or released from the oversold from the consciousness of the master to the minds of the disciple whereby the minds may be washed because the\n00:51 - Minds come in the way of the Splendor of the soul the Splendor of your soul is covered by the mud of your mind to put it directly the mud of the mind is the\n01:03 - negative mind the fety mind the undecisive mind the thinking mind the mind which is fickle which does not come to the direct Master for it solution but goes on the hearsay of\n01:19 - other people the rumor mongering mind the fickle mind a person or disciples who are steady In Their Own Strength they don't waver because they know that\n01:33 - the master shaking the apple tree and the guys who are flimsy will fall off and the guys who remain will be the guys who will they fit not that those guys who fallen off are bad but they can't\n01:44 - make the journey across the ocean with a leaking boat of disloyalty disloyalty is a huge hold hole in the boat you have to be firm you have to be loyal and strong this is what is\n01:57 - important and uh the more you relax that's what I'm saying how would you like me to serve you if you would like me to serve you to\n02:12 - the maximum as a server of humanity then you must relax your subconscious mind can't happen immediately like if you get a cramp you get a cramp here and you say\n02:26 - go stop relax it won't relax you say I'm telling you to relax and yet you're getting more and more and more subconscious mind is like that but then after some time it\n02:38 - relaxes within a few uh minutes or a few hours depending on how much tension or load you're carrying how much emotional baggage you're carrying which makes your mind very stiff and this creates a\n02:52 - resistance barrier all of you who are here with me have a 100% open mind to me I I but your subconscious mind is open only 30% 40% 50%\n03:15 - 60% can you please light up the back I can't see the people in the dark so you have to learn to take it but you can only take it if you relax your subconscious mind your subconscious mind\n03:31 - has a repression barrier of the limbic system the lyic system is a repression barrier you know the repression barrier is like water become ice water\n03:45 - is very fluid it doesn't have we can dive in it and all but nobody Dives in ice right that's going to be serious because many of boat have sunk and if you don't want to sink your\n03:57 - boat don't dive on ice by this I mean don't try to force apart the resistance of the lyic system the lyic system is worked upon by the master in the night the lyic system your\n04:12 - emotional barrier your emotional traumas there are many many many manyi traumas which form the coral reef in the turbulent ocean of your mind I have to dissolve the coral reef and\n04:26 - then only the back Ocean and the ocean this side can Bingle this is done that when when you sleep in the night that's the main time I do the\n04:38 - work this is just playing around you know with toys main work is done because I cannot explain that work to you but many have experienced this as you will experience it and that is a very\n04:51 - important factor which I have to tell you so as long as your limic system and the emotional traumas are not dampened it has I have to dampen the the\n05:05 - lyic system the moment your lyic system and your emotional resistance and your mental resistance and stress is dampened then my healing energy can go forth and do its work now do you know why gurunath\n05:20 - works in the night when you sleep because your egos don't come and ask me stupid question yes because the how can I you know tell me one common thing can you\n05:34 - explain something that which is beyond the mind with the Mind n so you have to explain Beyond mind with something like shaath I how many know what shaath is raise your\n05:48 - hands oh sorry how many who don't know shaath raise your hands so this is the first type they're coming so you will know that you will know that that will be\n05:58 - given where the consciousness of the master quells the ripples of thought and the mind of the disciple and makes him stand aside to know that he is the Atma and not the\n06:13 - body he is the the Living spirit the soul and not the body so to to some people have total Faith they come and they the system has automatically relaxed they dampen the lyic system and\n06:27 - therefore some people get healed quicker than others that is the reason I had one case in uh uh Delhi and I think you know that person\n06:43 - also so she went into the state and then she got this phase of schizophrenia and it went on for about almost 6 to 8 months they intervened I intervened with\n06:58 - this when I when when I did this cure her faith was so total that when I started in 21 days or 15 days I think it was 15 days there was a total cure she threw away her medicines and this thing\n07:13 - not that you don't have faith she was very new so she had no back baggage of past and the lyic system was dampened so when I dampen your Lim limic system your emotional trauma your\n07:28 - emotional stress when that barrier is dampened then my healing energy can seep into the deeper layers of your Consciousness into the deeper layers means into the the mind of past past\n07:43 - memories recalled memories Total Recall I have to give a Total Recall do you know what a Total Recall is have you all seen that movie Total Recall you haven't seen the movie Total\n08:01 - Recall swatsa [Music] movie well in that they couldn't get to Total Recall but they they made a good effort when you go back first on the\n08:15 - surface when I have to work with you are your frivolous thoughts and sometimes the thoughts are so stupid you all know that and you you why\n08:28 - you laugh because your doctors phds and directors and this and that but you have some thought somebody's there and you're dreaming and a man comes in front of you he has a mustache and you burst out\n08:40 - laughing why we don't know and then something and then then there comes a big fly onto the table and it turns into a tablespoon huh what is this is this my\n08:56 - mind these are fragments of my mind which are totally unre related and they are stupid how does a horsefly connect with a tablespoon and then I I'm sipping my uh\n09:09 - cup of tea and somehow that I hold a jug of wine and I'm pouring the wine in a wine glass this is what happens with frivolous thoughts because they are disconnected and not tied up there's no\n09:20 - tie up there's no logical sequence all of you must have had these thoughts I I and if we relate some of the stupid thoughts of dream we had we'd be laughing here we we'd have a whole\n09:33 - laughing session so at the surface what we work up is the frivolous thoughts they have no connection with one another and they can just be wiped off now as I talked to\n09:44 - you the vibrations of my words will wipe out those frivolous thoughts the vibrations of my words will wipe out those thoughts Pro provided you're open and receptive and you sit like a child\n09:56 - of five drop all inhibition drop all armas be a child of five don't listen to me drink me don't listen to me absorb me don't listen to me be\n10:15 - me you know why I'm using these these words which are too deep and which are direct we're telling you to do something because there are no words for the spiritual experience nor for The Words\n10:26 - which are the work that I do so after I finish this first stage with you which is already done with with all of you there are deeper layers behind behind the mental and emotional traumas\n10:38 - of the limic system which are thought forms now these thoughts become coherent and they connect with one another from the chaos of frivolous Whirlpool of thoughts there becomes a cosmos there\n10:52 - becomes an organized pattern of thought which is called a thought form an organized pattern of thought is called a thought form now the thought\n11:07 - form is something which is a connected thought with a form the house by the beach by the French Riviera the coconut trees the beach and the\n11:24 - waves coming like white maed lions the waves Rush at you as if to attack the white M Lions the Furious ocean and coming like white M Lions rushing at you as though to attack and as you stand\n11:38 - your ground those white maned lions the waves slowly subside and gradually slow down and come trickling at your feet to be humble from their arrogance The Arrogant wave is humble This Is the\n11:51 - destiny of all egos your he go like that like a wave",

          "title": "The Practice of Kriya Yoga - What You Need to Know",
          "transcript": "00:08 - how long we have to practice Kaa yog and how many times how much Kaa yog do we need to do for it to be effective and see results there were two\n00:28 - ladies these two ladies in India we have a common tap in The Villages and they take all their dishes and they start washing the dishes by the tap so both the ladies were\n00:41 - doing B I think a lot of you are from understand Hindi who doesn't understand Hindi here oh that's good okay so so in India like\n00:54 - in all other uh places of your respective countries when you go to The Villages there's a common tab where they wash the dishes the ladies usually washing\n01:04 - dishes so one lady said your utensil is shining and you finished in mine and I'm still scrubbing away what is the problem so the lady said that your utensil has a lot more\n01:19 - ghee in it and Masala so that take a little more time to come out so in Kaa yog who gets more Enlightenment to who progresses depends upon how much Masala of karma you have\n01:32 - to wash out some people have less Karma less action and reaction less negativity so they can see the Inner Light Of God quicker than those who have more karma they are both evolving at the same speed\n01:49 - but since the grme the the ghee of the karma is not being cleared as quick as the other person he sees it 6 months later later the other person sees it 6 months\n02:02 - earlier do you understand so the speed of Kaa yog will depend upon two factors how much negative Karma you have the more you have the longer it takes and secondly you the degree of\n02:15 - concentration applied degree of concentration applied to the spinal breathing the sadana it is very specific and gives you mathematical results very very specific half a minute\n02:29 - of spinal breathing concentrated half a breath of SP half a minute of spinal breathing is equal to one year of natural spiritual\n02:41 - unfoldment so the evolution depends upon the degree of concentration and how much Karma you have more karma you have the longer it will take and Visa be concentration faster you\n02:52 - concentrate then faster will be your Evolution suppose the man who has more negative Karma concentrates more than the man who is less Karma they\n03:03 - may get enlightened at the same time because his Evolution will be twice as fast du the degree of concentration applied I I okay how does Kayo helps in our daily\n03:25 - lives which is busy full of tension and stress satis satisfaction and unrest how will it help me lead a better life and bring a balance between work life family and\n03:49 - myself Kaa yog will do just what question has been asked that is the very purpose of Kaa yog thank you [Laughter]\n04:01 - [Music] there are so many forms of yoga then why K yoga why is it called lightning path and lightning path to what so this is a bit of a in-depth\n04:29 - question since there are many yoges why Kaa yog and why is K yog called the lightning path the Great Master ganar SRI yukar he\n04:45 - had developed a science called Cosmic astrology and uh he had placed the 12 signs of the zodiac within the spinal cord and the Shad chakras 6x6 polarities bar Rashi NOA all in the\n05:04 - spine when you concentrate and you make a microscopic picture of the macrocosm of our solar system within your spine the speed of your Evolution evolves because\n05:18 - you are traveling at a tremendous speed when you when you focus your concentration you you travel faster and faster so that you can travel at the speed of light this is the secret of\n05:30 - yoke and those Masters who bring concentration to a vanishing point travel at the speed of light their mass is infinite the great Masters like the Lord SRI Krishna pru ramchandra the\n05:46 - ganar yukar yogar Masa bhagan panjali bhagan Manu have all fulfill this awful condition and great people like aiah Ezekiel Moses Jesus Elijah they have also very\n06:03 - Advanced yogis and have fulfilled this they were all the same person reincarnating even zaratustra in his former life and latter life the great 12 zaratustra became gutam the\n06:15 - Buddha with Pythagoras as his disciple so these are great Souls the degree of their concentration increases the speed of the evolution and when your Evolutions goes towards the\n06:28 - speed of light of obviously in half a minute you can do one year of natural spiritual unfoldment the man who goes for his daily church service and praise and does\n06:39 - H har Krishna H har Ram or does many techniques Art of Living all good techniques but when he does the scientific K yog and he focuses his mind then his\n06:50 - Evolution that person will take one year which this person will do in half a minute so this is for Eagle Hearts who cannot wait this is for people who cannot wait\n07:01 - they don't want wealth and name and fame God I'm burning in my love for the Eternal infinite I cannot rest in peace now till I do become thy light if a person is so\n07:17 - intense then he will surely see the Lord and this is the right way this is for Eagle hearts and not for T tesses who go slowly by so it's an individual individual evolutionary thing\n07:30 - like I made a a poem in fary I do not want to become a beggar nor an angel I do not want fame nor the scepter\n07:52 - of the diamond of the Kings nor do I want the money they just give me this Consciousness just give me this\n08:04 - awareness oh Lord give me this Consciousness that I'm totally focused on thee and I become mad after thee because having got Thee I will get the whole\n08:28 - universe so this is this is this thing do you people understand how many people understood how many people understood what I said raise your hands raise your\n08:40 - hands because I I need a this this side okay okay pretty good for Manhattan area what do what area is this in New York huh\n08:55 - Queens okay then I have to speak in Chinese then [Music] next [Music]\n09:05 - still so this is uh what I have to say now next does k y brings healing peace joy happiness and fulfillment in Life or does it brings\n09:26 - transformation where practitioners will ultimately leave their current lives and become hermit living in the jungle or mountains jungle or mountains I'm going to take away\n09:46 - everything you like from your glass of beer to your nice family life to all your richy Rich money to your name and fame CAL c l m everything I'll take so that nobody\n10:04 - will come for yoga listen the Kaa yoga I've have come to teach is called the householders Kaa yog it's not the very\n10:19 - superal Kaa yog which is a blazing light but this is the householder the Crea yog meant for the householder and when you leave your cigarettes or when you leave your drinks\n10:33 - and wine you will have no trouble because it will automatically Fall Away by your own inner decision you'll not be motivated only to smoke or to earn money or be\n10:45 - greedy so it's an inner happening which takes place the flower Falls when the fruit appears the flowers of your desire will fall the fruit results of K yog will\n10:58 -

money of estava no mine state when your mind is attuned to my consciousness you might shall quickly be transformed into my populous consciousness and you should enjoy the list and profound peace to the\n01:18 - degree of your receptivity to me to the degree of your exploration explore feelingly send your feeling explorations and your feeding tentacles and to explore my mind the moment you pulled by\n01:31 - awareness your thoughts will become no mind you'll pick up my consciousness so you will be colored at the power of God thus consciousness is once essential god I so I'd say I'm breathing through your\n01:47 - breath beating through harder than I'd say thumb the moment I say come you get thoughtless and my consciousness I get ready I'm breathing through your breath now\n01:60 - and I'm eating through your heart and get into my soul state of Samadhi my soul consciousness of still mine awareness now you would avail yourself into me and I hate you and transform a\n02:13 - mind into my soul consciousness I'm beating through your heart now and leading to different but still you're minded thoughts now and may take my soul consciousness ready come\n03:25 - do not close your eyes the guys are burning I will show them just look at me the burning eyes will be soothed by rose water by calmness ready and have in my hand\n03:49 - now the eyes the comments we'll keep looking the aura is at the white company called national publicly it's radiating beyond the church right on Le Conte along the western coast to the Pacific\n04:05 - depends on how much of cycling see the face change to Moses and Jesus the official for the divine ones would have listened and a blessing okay come back to normal take a deep\n04:39 - breath and up and relax now people in the front and the back you have shared your just shared a very high yogic state of mind people ask me what is yoga the fusion of the disciple with the master\n04:56 - this yoga so you people have just been in a state of Holy Communion Holy Communion is you the fusion is you a fusion of the soul with the spirit of the master the disappearing of your mind\n05:14 - the uniting of your consciousness and my consciousness as soul this is yo yoga's unity where he pins it up we please we blow it up when we try to judge something don't touch it just to eat and\n05:27 - see it's an enjoyable is it ah a tunic rose thank you Wow finished that energy is not you should absorb it becoming the moment you pass the judgement ask the father stop I see\n05:49 - experience without it yeah I'm doing this all the standard question answers to people who just come casually by the Bible I come to McDonald's of foodstuff simply satsang I\n06:04 - should be talking on this to get you commit to me and come to play it over so now that's enough for today it's enough for you I don't want you to get spiritual indigestion I'd given you\n06:17 - enough and what doesn't Godspeed come to the prayer you come to India I am having a retreat people in the medical world can retreat because we say it's a campus they can't become a retreat at mount\n06:35 - Madonna they'll be spending three days with you he will spend quality time and it will not just be talking that's shown you today it will be transforming you do go do not come to me do not come to me\n06:53 - go away go away and go far so anybody who is honest enough to give you his soul experience to anybody who reads through your breath and anybody who makes us insane never to erase to aging\n07:08 - process to give you a healthy life praise God go away go and find him you must they must be people wrong you must go away if you don't want to go it then as a last resort come to me some of\n07:25 - the useless unless they are backed by a substantial experience and therefore the power if judges to lose their spiritual vacuum of a dynamic experience then they become empty shares\n07:38 - therefore Yogi's will have to fill the church or Padres of priests who can give a spiritual experience not just the intellectual dry map they'll have to give the waters of life in after\n07:51 - Sonne consciousness and experience is based on two facts it must be regulated and experienced to be a scientific hypothesis has two things it should be repeat be able to be\n08:05 - repeated again and again which it is because the scientists and people say that you people in all of us here we ignore those we just into flowering lucky stuff this is not logically stuff\n08:17 - that's why I come to you on behalf of the scientific and spiritual world on behalf of sanatana-dharma that we do have something solid together but your machines cannot catch it\n08:30 - your EEG scan our premortal smoke this is higher than alpha beta theta its nothingness and this nothingness is the blessings of the divine from which everything is created then go and ask\n08:48 - you some individual questions of self experiences first they should be repetative like the silence should come and they should have similar experiences if more than two or four people have\n08:60 - similar experiences repeatedly it can be based on a scientific hypothesis so we come and again and again and through this perhaps if the background is connect like if it is white which is not\n09:12 - here you would also be able to see the rose and white color or us they could be emitted not that we want to show that we are something we want to tell the scientific world another speed of\n09:23 - humanity is united let's have earth peace in selfies and let's create earth peace through sent peace i hi the whole purpose of this exercise the whole purpose\n09:36 - that summer is for earth peace to settle please do you understand me it's not about you and me it's about all of us I that's why I did to you this experience and plainclothesmen spiritual\n09:50 - progress by having this flow this experience first thing is that in this moment of time grade unit processes arrested secondly we get faith and confidence\n10:05 - that all of us experiencing the same piece right there for Humanity can be one so if you identify sessions repeatedly and I'd say the same thing individuals experiencing when your aging\n10:23 - process the body cells be arrested when the aging of your body cells be arrested more than those who don't attended regularly yes if you attend the satsang isn't even the master in satsang your\n10:35 - aging process will be arrested more and more in that movement of trend secondly we have what the confidence that all of us get the same experience therefore and the level of consciousness humanity is\n10:46 - one for earth peace we do this and thirdly I give you the statement because the first thing that if you want to see God in your minds they should be no ripples in your mind\n10:58 - sleep only when the revelers of thought in your mind slave have subsided then you can see the like who is the mother here tonight as a Jana said are the moon of my delight\n11:14 - Thomas no way you do not read your cookie box Babaji is the full moon every foot will be doing so without us knowing not couldn't complete nothing can be taken\n11:27 - from you even if everything is taken you are still full you are still complete then assuring the spiritual state it is the state of a fully enlightened being Bapuji shear correction ology the Buddha\n11:43 - Krishna Christ the moon of my delight and therefore directly a representative of God Himself all God himself not even representative there's nothing to be sad the apparent self is your body\n12:01 - which will be consigned to dust to dust of plane to plane but you as the eternal river of consciousness the soul lives on life and death are there chapter in the eternal story life and death birth and\n12:23 - death are but a chapter in your life story and you as the immortal river of soul consciousness know on so do not be decided play a drama in the life which has been given to you to play play your\n12:44 - enact your part when and when the curtain falls at the level of consciousness Humanity is one we should all be one okay now with the wave of the hand look\n13:02 - at me for the world engage rate have been a Tibetan I'm thinking three accounts are no still will be my soul consciousness experiments see what went wrong so like for the general course be\n13:12 - ready with no mind state of soul consciousness thoughtless awareness ready okay you know I experienced a high state of\n16:21 - you know called the on whatever stop the gnomon state of soul consciousness the master has shared with the disciples his soul consciousness take me attack well then put what other posture will\n16:35 - give you the same experience in whatever manner he chooses to we have at the time humanity is Spanish we are late the earth is burning the mother is burning isn't that the duty of us children what\n16:51 - a burn on this earth to give up a little bit to mother the Buddha I am finished from my path I hope your people whose good wishes and all the blessings of your stone will be\n17:06 - with me I'm with you forever for earth peace to send peace Shiva Shambo my yamuna maha shiva goraksha Gora Gora cannot hire",

          "transcript": "00:00 - ah ah it's a very very simple thing you're talking about the Ergo IDs or the archetypal man the archetypal man are\n00:34 - the 14 Manos in a day of Brahma just what I spoke about the man who wavers what is the spirit of humanity and also personified as a single archetypal man who's known as the archetype the Vipers\n00:48 - what maneuver in 2012 he will hand it to the other archetype man who may be sitting here who may be sitting there who may be sitting everywhere and now here you understand the other archetypal\n01:03 - man is known as the man whose power neither El Morya who is the archetypal man of the sixth which is born from the womb of the fifty you are you know who who is more\n01:45 - advanced a personal just limited or a personal cause into the dreams of a hundred people that's chapter surgery repairs their system astral body awakens their chakras moves the kundalini\n02:05 - through the chimney of the spine and gets them into the paradigm shift of a new dimension he's doing all this in his astral body the levitation actually happens in the astral body but a\n02:18 - physical body is left behind it is only for showmanship that the CDs are used why should you use your physical baggage and body when actually you can go and physically deliver a letter to another\n02:30 - person or give the message to another person why use the cumbersome body inspire hope in mankind of things what is the home that things are possible other than just becoming impossible when\n02:41 - you are not the physical body what are we going to inspire the wrong type of excuse my words gosh oh crap the body is a perishable garment in karmic women thrall and the mind is a\n02:57 - perishable comment you have to make the paradigm shift know that you are the soul when you are centered in the soul you can travel anywhere without limitation and contact anybody and do\n03:08 - the impossible beyond all the cities will be your servants with bowed heads and folded hands all - the massive days will stand before you and definitely this time is coming where more and more\n03:20 - people will begin to get enlightened and a time will an optimal time will come in the sake of where n Mass all people will be enlightened okay that is known as the coming of the Satya and definitely yes\n03:35 - the archetypal man first is called the Manu man man he is the man who from which manova humanity originates he is the spirit in all of us and yet he is individually personified as a single\n03:49 - human being this transition of one archetypal man who rules for 300 million years and transfers it to the other archetype of man who rules for another 300 million years this transition peak\n04:04 - point will come in 2012 you may know it you may not know it these two great souls will interact this is the archetype of man as far as the the the Merkava is concerned this is clearly\n04:18 - mentioned in the Calculon and those chariots with blazing gems blazing like the Sun symbolizing the 12 gemstones which are connected to the 12 signs of the zodiac and the constellations those\n04:34 - Chariots of Fire will come those Chariots of Fire their Thrones of fire will descend the thrones of fire will be converted into the vimana that is the aerial transport\n04:48 - these Chariots of Fire which studied with heavenly gems and jewels these to the the Kings before Horsemen of the Apocalypse will ride these chariots so all this has been given and this is the\n05:03 - time what I'm speaking about the markaba is the sacred seat and a replica upon which Indra gave Indra sits on markaba and the king in Shambhala is sitting on the Merkava the markaba is the sacred\n05:20 - throne which has the 12 signs of the zodiac the 28 nakshatras on it and from there the king of kings driven not salim kumar was an aspect of shiva goraksha babaji he rules this world from Shred\n05:36 - deep in sambal food which is now known as Shambhala it is mispronounced as Shambhala you are of Shambhala all your Shambhala I know sort of sambal food so sambal pool\n05:53 - yes so sambal pour is the place where the Kalki will be but there is another sample pool between the aurora borealis of the Northern Lights and the Gobi Desert this Sambalpur is also known as\n06:06 - red deep the white island which is a natural place so all these things are going to happen but we must not focus on the physical and perishable body and mind we must make the but first we must\n06:21 - get clear in our minds who are we are we the divine imperishable soul or are we the diseased body a Venus House of flesh and bone which sleeps the case and dies or are we the immortal consciousness\n06:36 - king of the earth instance we are not a body and have a soul we are a soul and have a body which is perishable garment so we leave so much investment in on the physical body which must ultimately be\n06:50 - consigned to the flames so which ideal utopia which egalitarian society are you talking about a society which will burn itself in the flames and after a period of eight years why are\n07:04 - you talking about the immortal souls that you are which will live on from life to life and from eternity to eternity let's simplify our language let's get to the point directly we are a\n07:15 - soul and have a body we are not a body and have a soul and if we are a soul we are immortal and so the realization of this immortality even without chariots even without levitation we will be\n07:27 - levitating it will be as common as your natural breathing this will come in about insatiable the end mass transition from the ignorance of body an association of mind to knowing that I am\n07:43 - Atma Brahma Umbra must me that I am this divine soul and not the de cable body I am spirit I'm truth I'm love divine this body mind a dream of mine close your eyes and say after me I'm spirit I'm\n08:01 - truth I'm love divine this body is but a dream of mine love divine body bind a dream of mine I'm spirit I'm truth I'm love divine this body mind a dream of mine\n08:30 - have you got the key essence of what we've come to learn here and what I've come to teach you feel that I have simplified this question a great deal I able to understand didn't move so the\n08:41 - markaba is no big deal Vikramaditya is written on the Merkabah by the throne which was given by Indra to him and he had the 28th officer oz on him and Raja Bhoj came to sit on the Merkava and he\n08:52 - was not allowed to sit on the marker bar because he was not a worthy King not as worthy as Vikramaditya but I'm talking about 57 BC and then go to me Putra shalivahana succeeded Vikramaditya but\n09:05 - then beyond the king vikramaditya beyond Vikramaditya our King Arthur is Vikram Aditya there's another which is King George the celestial Christ but beyond King George there is another\n09:21 - one who is the Christos the celestial Michael who is son of Kumar the slayer of the dragon okay I've written Sarkis or dark Ajit slayer of the great death the great dragon the Asura called our\n09:38 - Castle so therefore this is very important to understand that we are a spirit and definitely they will come a mass enlightenment yes this will be in the softy oak we're all Minds will be\n09:53 - enlightened nothing new has been set by our window nothing new has being set by the new age books we're all saying hickory dickory dock.the mouse ran up the clock the clock struck one the mouse\n10:03 - ran down hickory dickory dock that's my answer to all complicated fish I'm a simple guy uneducated from the village of sambal port there stay with my lord the Kal cake yes yes the questions have\n10:24 - been answered sati oak is the age now like now we are not in the Satya we are now personally this group is in Satya in the - until wherever there is a master at whichever place talking to\n10:38 - disciples talking to devoted listeners and lovers of God that place changes its aura its radiance from far-off even the nature spirits can see a light from the woods younger they are\n10:50 - think some of them are already around us they have been curious to know that what the Son of Man is doing we all the son of man we are divine inherently and to claim our birthright the fastest way the\n11:03 - Lightning path is Kriya yoga and yes levitation can be done if you open your heart and mind you will see me levitating in your rooms in the night tomorrow night when I call you up and\n11:14 - then I enter your dreams you will see me as per your mind which will allow it your mind has to be casted it out of your head the heart open and sleep very relaxed you've got nothing to do I have\n11:29 - to do all the work from the cosmic surgery the chakra surgery to cosmetic surgery of your chakra I will be doing so you don't have to worry you just have to relax and I will come and do the\n11:44 - needful once I do it you'll be ready forever and always till I come the next year and then my work will be much easier but I will do it in a moment in a flash you will even\n11:56 - see my physical body moving around and levitating it's not a big thing you don't think it's a big thing and don't go for levitation don't go for cities go for God I will tell you that light\n12:10 - cannot mix with darkness when the light goes there the darkness automatically disappears so therefore in LA when there are people of light if I go there and I have my\n12:23 - light or you show your light I show my light the darkness will disappear it has to because that is the cosmic law that's the divine law we do not hate the darkness we will we will accommodate the\n12:39 - darkness until I share with it but it is not our fault if it if the darkness cannot comprehend the light and the light shine it in the darkness and the darkness comprehended it not this is the\n12:57 - lightless light which lights that light which lights the light of all our souls its frequency is so much but the whole areas lit up as I see the whole there is little one master comes the whole town\n13:11 - is little but that frequency is so high but when I'm sitting like I was sitting in the evening how many of you could see the aura around the body just say I where I was sitting at the in the hall\n13:23 - in the night there you are the light as they even when the light shines the light of the soul is shining there yeah so Gurunath what is it when the your body breaks out the white breaks and\n13:36 - that shows that man's essential nature spirit he has to be stripped off his physical emotional and mental bodies and stand naked before the Lord God and Mergent to the Lord God who is the\n13:48 - ultimate nakedness the naked singularity beyond all singularities you have to go stripped and bare stripped and bare for the nature of man is spirit and the practice of yoga stripping you of all\n14:04 -

          "transcript": "00:02 - the only purpose of man's seran on this Earth is to seek God I come to you in the night in the Dream Weaver I'm doing the BAU with you every\n00:16 - time and with all modesty I say all humility here in the Known World nobody else is doing it I have to make it clear to knock off the BS in your mind that you're coming here you're very special\n00:27 - people that you come here and I will do the dream to the shortcoming will not be from my side when I appear appear to you in the dream in the Bardo and I clear your\n00:38 - negativity and the BS I always tell you don't I that I'm the garbage man and you're the can so open the can let the garbage man do his work and clean you when it is\n00:52 - repeatedly done and the master touches you in your astral and causal body then the process of cleansing starts per Tre is just a process of cleansing the DEA Chan the Bardo is a process of cleansing\n01:05 - we don't need to do it we've long passed it so you will come into your B and we'll clean it all at once so only when you repeatedly practice on the track and field\n01:18 - events Michael Phelps anyone heard of Michael Phelps do you know the sort of practice he does I I saw a video in which he practiced they lay their life on the line man you can't just go go and\n01:32 - say at the last moment now I'm a water torpedo I'm a I'm going to beat him I'm going to go at the speed of light I'm it won't do it won't do till for 100 lives you practice in the pool and you're\n01:47 - swimming then you will be born a human fish a barracuda then you'll get the speed so what we are trying to do here with you do you understand that this is not merely a fun game or something\n02:01 - I'm I'm here trans transforming your lives to cross the bridge of samsar to cross the bridge of the not only the physical but the astral and get to straight to the clear light of the\n02:18 - chaitan the inner star shanetra Tara the star of the eye of Shiva the jewel in the soul and therefore you need practice these techniques they are all moving towards\n02:34 - life so after your life you will not die you will get to the Great Awakening I need to tell you something and I will confess before you many\n02:50 - people many people have faith in me and they have come and told me gurunath we have been to many teachers but I have come to you I did\n03:07 - not have faith there that they would be by my bedside when I died they Ed the word death I said I'll be there when you awaken not die and\n03:22 - they told me that because I have faith I with you because there's something in you that I feel that you can do it even when you're not in this body and the day before yesterday I\n03:34 - won't take names I was put to a test not once or twice and both the times the person before dying I'm telling you this to have Solace that I promise you that you\n03:45 - will not those who practice sincerely the Kaa yoga and joti mudra will not die in darkness they will be ushered By the Light to the great tunnel of Joy to satad the existence Consciousness and\n03:58 - Bliss and even if you go to the the Bardo you will be saved and protected by the guru every path every footstep of the path this is a\n04:09 - fact amen and so so when he went he said you want this photo Jesus or Krishna this thing he said no just get me gurunath and he got my photo and while he was passing away he closed his eyes\n04:26 - and he said I can see him even with closed eyes I have no pain in the cancer no pain in my postrate my throat my lungs I'm in Bliss I am going it is not my effort because I've not made enough\n04:41 - it is his effort and I am gone so when I got this news I myself had not confidence that I would keep my word it is a great\n04:55 - responsibility to be by the bedside of a person when he gets through his greatest moment of of of joy is when you when what you call is death because that is not your death that is the Awakening\n05:07 - into the Divine Light in our philosophy we have no death as Lord Krishna has said you are the Divine soul of Arjun your body but comment is in karmic web enthralled you are the Divine Soul Focus\n05:27 - not on the body but focus on the soul for you are the Divine Soul the water cannot wet you the breeze cannot Bry you the weapons cannot Pierce you the fire cannot burn you you are the immortal\n05:40 - Atma Arjun and therefore live without fear fight the good battle for if you win you shall rule as Supreme King and if you you die you shall attain final Mo so this is Arjun was known as the\n05:54 - great the mahat tapan the great Tapas it's constant and deep meditation for years so this is my message to you don't get caught up in\n06:05 - emotions don't get caught up in the BAU there's no need this is for the yogis I'm speaking to the yogis now you'll ask me how about the Ordinary People yes for the ordinary people in\n06:19 - India we have three processes when a person dies or after he is dead to guide him like in Tibet they have one process which was taken from Indian books which\n06:33 - nagar Arjun wrote was taken to Tibet and preserve then is called the Tibetan Book of the Dead which is not a tiban book of the dead it is the Indian Book of the\n06:43 - Dead or if you want to be like that but I'm saying it's the human book it is to guide people by constant vibration after they have left their physical body to go back to its\n06:55 - elements they have one book which has come from the land of India land of Libations the tapoi so there are three\n07:09 - processes when a person dies a normal death he has to go through pergatory he is not like us a yogi practicing and neither has gurunath given them the word that even\n07:22 - if you don't practice I will be by your bed side no so they have a book called the gud puran the guru puran the purana is the ancient history and genealogy of all\n07:34 - your ancestors all your families and spiritual practices which are done so you not only pay the debt of your karmic Leisure of yourself but also of your ancestors it\n07:50 - is called the garud puran so this is for normal people it is read for 10 days the same practices in Tibet after after 3 days the soul disengages itself from the\n08:07 - Ethereal and physical body the same is given in the the Persian uh doctr of the zavasta of the pares 72 hours India says 72 hours Tibetan y 72 hours after that the\n08:22 - reading of the guran Carries On for 10 days during this process the soul is guided step by step into the places it goes and it is told what it is an old language many of\n08:38 - it is metaphorical it has to be taken in a practical sense and interpreted it's codified the gud pan it has to be taken in a practical sense that every action has an equal and opposite reaction\n08:52 - whatever he did karmically he has to repay in those U those uh AST natural spheres Baha then there is another Book of the Dead for people who have died a\n09:10 - premature death an accident an accident and in unforeseen circumstances there we have a pole so it is known as a pachic death then for him they the person to listen after 72 hours\n09:28 - they'd have a pole on it which they have an Asen like this and they tie the red Asen it's red in color the dead Soul comes there and listens that is called the\n09:39 - [Music] bhagwat they read the bhagwat the resonant frequency and the vibrations of the bagat release that soul from its astral shell and lets it go to the\n09:52 - causal shell the shells have to be broken as they are guided through the paths and tunnels and various alleway they're not only tunnels they oceans to swim their\n10:04 - mountains to climb their tunnels to go through the tunnel of light comes later the tunnel of clear light even the cosmos has to go through the great Wormhole even our galaxy is subject to\n10:16 - this the book of The Great Awakenings so the first book of the Great Awakening which you which is a misnomer Called Death is called the guran the second book of the Great Awakening guiding you\n10:27 - through these difficulties is the bhagwatam and the third for liberated Soul either you can read the shiv puran or the bhagwad Gita so these these books are guiding factors to the soul that is\n10:39 - departed from the body but is still lingering lingering in its in its astral form it lingers and to break that lingering spook that that astral being which sometimes you see operations and\n10:53 - ghosts that is the soul which is marking time that this Liberation happens suppose a soul is to live 80 years it dies at the a premature death at the age of 50 years it marks typ it marks time\n11:10 - in limbo for 30 years I I'm giving you this knowledge because it was needed you needed to have a certain background so according to the great\n11:23 - Chinese philosopher Leu Tang he says that India is the source and the mother of all spiritual language a trickle of it went out and inundated the whole the whole of Southeast Asia and later its\n11:35 - fragrance and influence spread to the Western World the deepest known and codified language in the minds of the people very bad Indians at writing and codifying\n11:48 - today when you go you will meet people who will chant 10 Bibles all by heart in one shot they have it printed in the indelible substance of the\n12:02 - mind this is very important to know and you must be rested at this that we are taking you this is the main factor to scoop you out of that that space this is only for you not the common lot the\n12:17 - people who practice Kaa yog shall not die in darkness provided it's a sincere persevering practice don't take this as some tea talk or par talk\n12:31 - and it is not come walk into my Palace said the spider to the said the spider to the fly it's not a trap either I'm not a spider and you're not the fly but you I will liberate from the web of the\n12:45 - spider of delusion illusion and error you are in the web you think you are a physical body and have a soul the greatest gift of India is is its patterns of breathing\n12:57 - where it teaches you to disengage from the trems of the senses and free your soul to unite with the infinite spirit of God this is the sumon substance of the\n13:08 - teachings this is the purpose the only purpose of of your journey on this Earth is to seek God don't seek bar Bal don't seek\n13:20 - Purgatory don't seek anything less the yogi as you are strong catch it by the for loock and throw it out of the window I'm very strong against this teaching\n13:32 - because I have been one of the main proponents of Tibetan yog and Buddhism and I was born in India long time back ago and I went to Bhutan and Tibet and set up all their system do you\n13:47 - know that we they had no language of their own do you know where the language came from for Tibet it came from India the great Scholars and yogis of India chocked out a language which is spoken\n13:60 - by them called the Tibetan language now the son is telling the father come I will teach you some yog old wine in new bottles so please don't get mixed up because many of you\n14:14 - going I would not go into the sphere of the emotional body it's very bad it gets it wastes a lot of time be clear have compassion but don't get involved in Emotion the astral body is to be\n14:28 - cleansed thoroughly and this is done by the constant breathing of Kaa yog Kaa yog is the factor",

          "transcript": "00:07 - [Music] [Music] [Music] it&#39;s a very very simple thing you&#39;re talking about the ago ideas the\n00:30 - archetypal man the archetypal man are the 14 Manus in a day of Brahma it&#39;s just what I spoke about the Manu vwat is the spirit of humanity and also personified as a single archetypal man\n00:46 - who known as the archetype the bashat Manu in 2012 he will hand it to the other archetype man who may be sitting here who may be sitting there who may be sitting everywhere and now he here do\n01:01 - you understand the other archetypal man is known as the Manu Saar the El Moria who is the archetype of man of the sixth subrace which is born from the womb of the fifth Arian root race but\n01:16 - you&#39;re the Manu oh whoever he is maybe you are you look like Mario you also have a beard you know you know it may be anyone but it is do we get to levitate is my\n01:29 - point and is that very specific question we honestly tell me this is possible please man there still some Hope and Faith in Me man I&#39;m so disappointed with Humanity to some\n01:43 - degree who who is more advanced a person who just levitates or a person who goes into the dreams of a 100 people does chakra\n01:56 - surgery repairs their system astral body body awakens their chakras moves the Kundalini through the chimney of the spine and gets them into the Paradigm Shift of a new dimension he&#39;s doing all\n02:12 - this in his astral body the levitation actually happens in the astral body where the physical body is Left Behind it is only for Showmanship that the Sidis are used why should you use your\n02:25 - physical baggage and body when astrally you can go and physically deliver a letter to another person or give the message to another person why use the cumbersome body maybe to inspire hope in\n02:36 - mankind that things are what is the that things are possible other than just becoming a possible when you are not the physical body what are we going to inspire the wrong type of excuse my\n02:48 - words BOS or Crap the body is a perishable garment and karmic web enthralled and the mind is a perishable garment you have to make the paradigm shift know that you are the\n03:01 - soul when you&#39;re centered in the soul you can travel anywhere without limitation and contact anybody and do the impossible beyond all the siddhis will be your servants with bowed heads\n03:13 - and folded hands all the Asam Maha Sidis will stand before you and definitely this time is coming where more and more people will begin to get enlightened and a time will an optimal time will come in\n03:25 - the SAT yog where n m all people will be enlightened okay okay that is known as the coming of the SAT yog and definitely yes the archetypal man first is called the Manu man man he\n03:41 - is the Manu from which man Humanity originates he is the spirit in all of us and yet he is individually personified as a single human being this transition of one archetypal\n03:54 - man who rules for 300 million years and transfers it to the other archetype man who rules for another 300 million years this transition Peak point will come in\n04:06 - 2012 you may know it you may not know it these two great Souls will interact this is the archetyp of man as far as the the the maraba is concerned this is clearly mentioned in the kip\n04:19 - puran and those chariots with blazing gems blazing like the sun symbolizing the 12 gemstones which are connected to the 12 signs of the zodiac and the constellations those Chariots of Fire\n04:35 - Will Come Those Chariots of Fire their Thrones of fire will descend the Thrones of fire will be converted into the viman that is the aial transport in these Chariots of Fire\n04:50 - which studded with Heavenly gems and jewels these two uh the the the Kings The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse will ride these chariots so all this has been given and this is\n05:03 - the time what I&#39;m speaking about the maraba is the sacred seat and a replica upon which Indra gave Indra sits on a maraba and the king in Shambala is sitting on the\n05:17 - maraba the maraba is the sacred Throne which has the 12 signs of the zodiac the 28 nakshatras on it and from there the King of Kings Jag sonat Kumar who is an aspect of shiv\n05:32 - goraka Babaji he rules this world from Deep In sambalpur which is now known as Shambala it is mispronounced as Shambala you heard of Shambala all you heard of Shambala and\n05:45 - who heard of sambalpur hi from where through you I come TOA so sambalpur supur is yes so sambalpur is the place where the Ki will be but there\n05:58 - is another sambalpur between the Aurora Borealis of the northern lights and the GOI desert this sambalpur is also known as deep the white Island which is an astral\n06:12 - place so all these things are going to happen but we must not focus on the physical and perishable body and mind we must make the first we must get clear in our minds who are we are we the Divine\n06:26 - imperishable Soul or are we the diseased body are we this house of Flesh and Bone which sleeps decays and dies or are we the immortal Consciousness King of the\n06:37 - earth and skies we are not a body and have a soul we are a soul and have a body which is perishable garment so if we lay so much investment in on the physical body which\n06:49 - must ultimately be consigned to the Flames so which ideal Utopia which egalitarian society are you talking about a society which was burn itself in the flames and the ashes after a period\n07:02 - of 80 years while you talking about The Immortal Souls that you are which will live on from life to life and from eternity to Eternity let&#39;s simplify our language\n07:12 - let&#39;s get to the point directly we are a soul and have a body we are not a body and have a soul and if we are a soul we are Immortal and so the realization of this immortality even without chariots\n07:25 - even without levitation we will be levitating it will be as common as your natural breathing this will come in about in sat yog the End\n07:35 - Mass transition from the ignorance of body and Association of mind to knowing that I am Atma Brahma brahmasmi that I am this Divine soul and not the Decay\n07:51 - body I am spirit I am truth I love divine this body mind the dream of mine close your eyes and say after me I&#39;m Spirit I&#39;m truth I&#39;m love divine I&#39;m Spirit I&#39;m truth I&#39;m love divine this\n08:06 - body is but a dream of mine this body is I&#39;m Spirit I&#39;m truth I&#39;m love divine truth love this body mind dream of mine this dream of I&#39;m Spirit I&#39;m truth I&#39;m love divine this body mind the\n08:22 - dream of mine I&#39;m have you got the key essence of what we&#39;ve come to learn here and what I&#39;ve come to teach do you feel that I have simplified his question a great deal are\n08:38 - you able to understand it now so the maraba is no big deal viad is written on the maraba by the throne which was given by Indra to him and he had the 28 aaras on him and Raja BJ came\n08:50 - to sit on the maraba and he was not allowed to sit on the maraba because he was not a worthy King not as worthy as vikramaditya this I&#39;m talking about 57 BC\n09:01 - and then gami Putra shahan succeeded vikramaditya but then beyond the king vikramaditya beyond vikramaditya our King Arthur is vikramaditya there&#39;s another which is King George the\n09:18 - celestial Christ but beyond King George there is another one who is the Christos the celestial Michael who is sanatkumar the Slayer of the Dragon okay\n09:31 - I taras tarit Slayer of the great great Dragon theur called tasu so therefore this is very important to understand that we are a spirit and definitely there will come a mass\n09:49 - Enlightenment yes this will be in the SAT where all Minds will be enlightened nothing new has been said by arabindo nothing new is being said by the new age books who are all saying he Dickory Dock\n10:01 - the mouse ran up the clock the Clock Struck One the mouse ran down Hickory Dickory Dock that&#39;s my answer to all complicated questions I&#39;m a simple guy uneducated\n10:13 - from the village of sambalpur I stay with my Lord the [Music] k sorry to be so brose yes yes the questions have been answer sat is the\n10:25 - age in the SAT now like now we are not in the SAT we are now personally this group is in sat yog in the minor sat wherever there is a master at whichever place talking to disciples talking\n10:39 - to devoted listeners and lovers of God that place changes its Aura it&#39;s radian from far off even the nature Spirits can see our light from the woods Yonder they are things some of them are already\n10:52 - around us they have been curious to know that what the son of man is doing we are all the son of man we are Divine inheritance and to claim our Birthright the fastest\n11:03 - way the lightning path is cria yog and yes levitation can be done if you open your heart and mind you will see me levitating in your rooms in the night tomorrow night when I call you up and\n11:15 - then I enter your dreams you will see me as per your mind which will allow it your mind has to be cassed out of your head the heart opened and sleep very relaxed you got nothing to do I\n11:29 - have to do all the work from the cosmic surgery the chakra surgery to cosmetic surgery of your chakras I will be doing so you don&#39;t have to worry you just have to relax and\n11:43 - I will come and do the needful once I do it you&#39;ll be ready forever and always till I come the next year and then my work will be much easier but I will do it in a moment and\n11:55 - a flash you will even see my physical body moving around in lit ating it&#39;s not a big thing don&#39;t think it&#39;s a big thing and don&#39;t go for levitation don&#39;t go for Sidis go for God I will tell\n12:08 - you that light cannot mix with darkness when the light goes there the darkness automatically disappears so therefore in La when there are people of light if I go there and I\n12:23 - have my light or you show your light I show my light the darkness will disappear it has to because that is the cosmic law that&#39;s the Divine Law we do not hate the\n12:36 - darkness we will we will accommodate the darkness and share with it but it is not our fault if it if the darkness cannot comprehend the light and the light shineth in the\n12:51 - darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not this is the lightless light which lights that light which lights the light of all our souls its frequency is so\n13:04 - much like the whole area is lit up as I see the whole area is lit up one master comes the whole town is lit up but that frequency is so high but when I&#39;m sitting like I was sitting in the\n13:16 - evening how many of you could see the aura around the body just say I I when I was sitting at the in the hall in the night there you are the light is there even when the light shines the light of\n13:27 - the soul is shining there yeah so gurunath what is it when the your body breaks up the light breaks up that shows that man&#39;s essential nature Spirit he has to be stripped off his\n13:41 - physical emotional and mental bodies and stand naked before the Lord God and merge into the Lord God who is the ultimate nakedness the naked Singularity beyond all\n13:52 - singularities you have to go stripped and bear stripped and bear for the nature of man is Spirit and the practice of yog is stripping you of all your false Notions\n14:06 - all your physical emotional mental bodies and especially all your siddhis choose you have God on one side and you have Sidis on the other [Music]\n14:36 -

          "title": "The Master is Breathing Through Your Breath",
          "transcript": "00:01 - oh the only purpose of man sergeant on this earth is to seek God [Music] and today we get on to the second phase the experiential satsang the purpose of\n00:34 - this satsang is to first is to show you that humanity is tied by the self same cord of love through breath humanity is tied by the self same code of breath through love\n00:51 - whichever way you may put it the second purpose of giving you this experience is to to give you the confidence that no matter how far you are and if you sincerely open your heart and cry out\n01:14 - not only to me but to any Sadhguru if he is a Sadhguru if he is a true master then that master will approach you and help you if I can breathe through your breath from ten yards away then I can\n01:32 - breathe through your breath ten thousand miles away I so this is to give you the confidence that a master's hand can stretch anywhere over the globe to help a sincere disciple striving for\n01:49 - self-realization that is the purpose and before I begin let me tell you I think you must have been given a brief idea as to what is to be done you have to sit relaxed with open body language you\n02:09 - don't have to close not know close to body language like this open body language and when your body language is open do not sit thinking Lee sit feelingly\n02:29 - that means shift your consciousness from your head to your heart when you shift your consciousness from your head to your heart the rainbow bridge of the master connects to your\n02:43 - heart the rainbow bridge of your heart this is another thing which shows that a true master is equal unto all people at all times he has no favorites except that all of\n03:00 - you are favorites and he loves you with the same intensity because in America they have a word but they do not know the meaning of the word which I will tell them something in their own\n03:18 - language they talk about hey man he's put his life on the line life means brown life force energy he's put his life on the line for you it's a very big and serious statement today I will put\n03:35 - my life on the line for you literally literally my life force energy I will breathe my life was through your breath I - those who are receptive they will get it very strong and clear to those\n03:55 - who are not those who have attitude will get it less because naturally that the attitude will come in the way those who sit as simple as a child of five feelingly forming the Rainbow Bridge\n04:11 - between heart to heart will get the breathing when you are breathing normally and looking at me or closing your eyes I shall clap to indicate that I am\n04:22 - coming into your breath Oh moment this is an indication moment I clap the hop your breath at that moment if you are receptive to me will become longer richer and deeper it'll be like a boost\n04:40 - where you're breathing on your own you're pulling your breath up and down [Applause] it'll get boosted at the moment I clap and you're receptive but you must keep\n04:55 - breathing and as you keep breathing after I've made the sound with every breath your breath will become lighter and effortless so much so that the sensitive of you will realize that I am\n05:08 - pushing your breath up and down that means what do you call it breath secretary right secretary of state so you will have a very pompous breath a Pompeo breath right we see you\n05:28 - you will breathe if urgent with less effort you understand is there any questions you must sit relaxed open body language anybody any questions before I begin yeah yes what\n05:51 - yes please just have a little willful breath inhale gently and exhale gently and be receptive to me that song let's not make a big deal about it let's start casually you know don't let me down but\n06:11 - even if you do it doesn't matter I'll do it again okay are you ready you're ready now start breathing with open eyes or closed eyes wait for the clap the moment I clap your\n06:33 - breath will become longer richer and deeper are you ready ready keep breathing good with every breath it'll become lighter\n07:06 - and lighter and then soon you will feel that I'm assisting a breath maximum your breath is flowing with great facility and ease keep breathing be in tune with me from the Rainbow\n07:18 - Bridge between your heart and my heart and breathe excellent let the mine drop sit feelingly open the heart [Applause]\n07:55 - this is the master helping the disciple during his practice of Kriya yoga he passes through the DNA of the six chakras of the disciple and sets the DNA alight with knowledge corrects it the\n08:22 - master weaves the tapestry of the disciples karma taking out the negativity and putting positive DNA in its place you feel that the breath of the Masters assisting your breath and\n08:46 - your breath is flowing effortlessly okay relax and rest to be receptive is your own gain so open your eyes and relax now I'm going to see a lot of people who are new I will do it again I\n09:32 - want you to understand I'm going to take a feedback I'm gonna make you raise your hand you can look back and check it out how many people receive and don't even if you receive a little boost of the\n09:43 - breath becoming longer richer and deeper and me assisting your breath raise your hands those will receive the lengthing of the breath raise your hands okay look back those who haven't looked\n09:54 - back and see all those who have received it please turn around you can stand up and look back so that you know that this is not a hallucination people do receive it and now we will go on to the next\n10:07 - experience who haven't received it raise your hands yeah did you receive even a little bit of a lightning of breath or energy moving did you feel even a little energy moving right without the breath\n10:20 - some energy was moving okay then you've received it but I'm going to do it again who didn't receive it did everybody receive at this side all right I've got to do this again if you let your mind\n10:37 - interfere you get nervous then it blocks the experience as you've seen already 90 to 95 percent of the people have experienced my breath in your breath my life force because the force is the same\n10:51 - the forces of divine I can relieve my force because nothing holds it back I have no desire but your evolution and progress I'm gonna do it again keep the body\n11:12 - relaxed drop the shoulders and when you're breathing normally suppose your breath is like this when it gets a boost it lengthens or becomes stronger like to those who are receptive could you hear\n11:35 - that could you hear what I did just now the breath become why don't so I am trying to stretch out to you and help you in your progress evolution is done in the spine the life force energy and\n11:49 - the breath move in the spine in Kriya yoga so now we will do it once again are you ready has anybody any questions those who are on heavy medication may not receive it\n12:06 - and those who get nervous and suddenly startled or overexcited they will not get it so you have to be totally relaxed sit feeling they're not thinking Lea just be totally relaxed and the moment I\n12:19 - clap your breath will lengthen ready breathe [Applause] very good tune in to me now drop the mind and open the heart sit feelingly\n12:43 - ready I'm trying to teach you I'm not trying to impress you I'm going to teach you that the moment the sound was indicated by sound your breath became longer richer deeper keep breathing\n13:05 - the universal breath is one breath the breath of God [Applause] [Applause] sit feelingly don't think just feel like\n13:27 - when you're having a gelato you don't think you just enjoy to enjoy the breath the sound of my breath over the mic will lengthen your breath what do we do in this what am I trying to do I'm trying\n13:47 - to unite humanity is one phenomena and if we unite humanity is one phenomena come unity humanity there will be peace on earth and goodwill to all humankind so you have to cooperate in this this\n14:04 - experiment this great process of love [Applause] with my breath [Applause] and if you tuned into me or what would\n14:31 - become longer and deeper to the degree of your attunement to the sound of breath that you hear [Applause] relax open your eyes and relax now the\n15:11 - second time of the people who didn't receive it last time and all of you who received it this time better raise your hands excellent so you got the hang of it who\n15:22 - didn't receive it after the second time raise your hands second time - who didn't receive it even then everybody received it who didn't receive it okay so this is very good the\n15:37 - purpose of this movement is to tell the world key look why is there such hatred amongst the nations and the peoples of this earth if we breathe one breath which I am demonstrating if there was no\n15:55 - connection between you and me could I have read through you know because there is a connection between humanity person to person we breathe through the other eye okay so this is the message so the\n16:11 - first gate for the initiation to kriya yoga has been opened tomorrow when you come to Korea Europe I've laid my life on the line I breathe through your breath corrected your DNA at the first\n16:25 - level tomorrow I will try to give you my Samadhi he will share my samadhi i will give you my thought free state of enlightened awareness this was a state of Kundalini\n16:44 - I gave you tomorrow I will give you the state of my soul that is the state of our soul which is a thought free state of profound tranquility thought free state of profound peace which is the\n16:59 - first state of enlightenment now before this session comes to an end today my advice to you is take it on the high many times you try to take it on\n17:19 - the tide if you have many of you been body surfing or not I don't know but body surfing it requires more skill and is more difficult than more surfing and many times we try and the wave goes by\n17:32 - us but sometimes when we try we catch the wave on our body and we go straight so catch the wave at the right time don't miss an opportunity let not press with Precious Moments slip\n17:47 - by seek now the ultimate truth or soul sworn spread your wings to fly in mortal realms which death defy and so you will be the making of a perfect race a perfect you a perfect community in the\n18:07 - days to come of course it matters of course it matters it matters because it removes all irrelevant matter and takes you to spirit because if you're in matter it\n18:23 - wouldn't matter you know it's like a like a sow a female pig wallowing in the slush so man says hey Pig come out I'll give you a better life so the pig says no unhappy wallowing in this crap\n18:48 - so also there are higher beings than us who try to pick us out of our garbage and say come on souls we take you some those to whom it doesn't matter who are steeped in matter of materialism don't\n19:02 - make the effort and those of you to whom it matters make it your life's purpose to remove the veil of matter and see the Spirit of the Lord that how that's why matter matters you have to make matter\n19:23 - in material in your life towards spirit ohm namah shivay and now with this I have said what I have to say I have given you the experience of the breath to those who I have not because once you\n19:47 - I touch you with my breath and I can work on the D DNA and the Dreamweaver which I will be working at a chasta and when I visit in the night I work on the evolution the DNA to those who are\n20:03 - receptive I cannot say which of you will be receptive to me when you sleep most of you will be and the work goes on the good work the charming work the glorious\n20:13 - work to see our Lord the Lord of a radiant splendor who resides within and without us",

          "transcript": "00:04 - the only purpose of man's sergeant on this earth is to seek god [Music] and today we get on to the second phase\n00:29 - the experiential satsang the purpose of this satsang is to first is to show you that humanity is tied by the self-same\n00:43 - god of love through breath humanity is tied by the self-same code of breath through love whichever way you may put it the second\n01:00 - purpose of giving you this experience is to to give you the confidence that no matter how far you are and if you sincerely open your heart\n01:13 - and cry out not only to me but to any sad guru if he is a sad guru if he is a true master then that master will approach you and help you if i can breathe through your\n01:28 - breath from 10 yards away then i can breathe through your breath 10 000 miles away i [Music]\n01:38 - so this is to give you the confidence that a master's hand can stretch anywhere over the globe to help a sincere disciple\n01:48 - striving for self-realization is the purpose and before i begin let me tell you i think you must have been given a brief\n02:04 - idea as to what is to be done you have to sit relaxed with open body language you don't have to close not no closed body language like this\n02:14 - open body language and when your body language is open do not sit thinkingly\n02:26 - sit feelingly that means shift your consciousness from your head to your heart when you shift your consciousness from\n02:37 - your head to your heart the rainbow bridge of the master connects to your heart the rainbow bridge of your heart this is another thing which shows\n02:51 - that a true master is equal unto all people at all times he has no favorites except that all of you are favorites and he loves you with the same intensity\n03:05 - because in america they have a word but they do not know the meaning of the word\n03:15 - which i will tell them something in their own language they talk about hey man he's put his life on the line\n03:25 - life means pran life force energy he's put his life on the line for you it's a very big and serious statement today i will put my life\n03:37 - on the line for you literally literally my life force energy i will breathe my life force through your breath i\n03:49 - okay to those who are receptive they will get it very strong and clear to those who are not those who have attitude will get it less\n04:01 - because naturally that the attitude will come in the way those who sit as simple as a child of five feeling the forming the rainbow bridge\n04:12 - between heart to heart will get the breathing when you are breathing normally and looking at me or closing your eyes i shall clap to indicate that i am\n04:22 - coming into your breath moment this is an indication moment i clap the hook your breath at that moment if you're receptive to me\n04:34 - will become longer richer and deeper it'll be like a boost where you're breathing on your own you're pulling your breath up and down\n04:45 - [Applause] it'll get boosted the moment i clap and you're receptive but you must keep breathing and as you keep breathing\n04:58 - after i've made the sound with every breath your breath will become lighter and effortless so much so that the sensitive of you will realize that i am pushing your breath up and down\n05:10 - that means what do you call it breath secretary right secretary of state they say you you will breathe effulgent\n05:25 - with less effort do you understand is there any questions you must sit relaxed open body language anybody any questions before i begin\n05:50 - have a little willful breath inhale gently and exhale gently and be receptive to me that's all let's not make a big deal about it let's start casually you know\n06:04 - don't let me down but even if you do it doesn't matter i'll do it again okay are you ready are you ready now start breathing with open eyes or closed eyes wait for\n06:25 - the clap the moment i clap your breath will become longer richer and deeper [Applause] are you ready [Laughter]\n06:44 - ready ah keep breathing good with every breath it will become lighter and lighter and then soon you will feel\n07:02 - that i am assisting your breath maximum your breath is flowing with great facility and ease keep breathing be in tune with me from the rainbow bridge between your heart and my heart\n07:14 - and breathe excellent [Applause] let the mind drop sit feelingly open the heart\n07:41 - [Applause] this is the master helping the disciple during his practice of kriya yoga he passes through the dna of the six chakras of the disciple and sets the dna\n08:03 - alight with knowledge corrects it [Applause] the master weaves the tapestry of the disciples karma\n08:20 - taking out the negativity and putting positive dna in its place you will feel that the breath of the masters assisting your breath and your breath is flowing effortlessly\n08:50 - [Applause] okay relax and rest to be receptive is your own gain so\n09:13 - open your eyes and relax now i'm going to see a lot of people who are new i will do it again i want you to understand i'm going to\n09:26 - take a feedback i'm going to make you raise your hand you can look back and check it out how many people receive and don't even if you receive a little boost of the breath becoming longer richer and\n09:36 - deeper and me assisting your breath raise your hands those who receive the lengthening of the breath raise your hands okay look back those who haven't looked back and see all those who've\n09:47 - received it please turn around you can stand up and look back so that you know that this is not a hallucination people do receive it and now we will go on to the next\n09:59 - experience who haven't received it raise your hands your did you receive even a little bit of a lightening of breath or energy moving did you feel even a little energy\n10:08 - moving right without the breath some energy was moving okay then you've received it but i'm going to do it again who didn't\n10:17 - receive it did everybody receive at this side i okay i'm going to do this again\n10:27 - if you let your mind interfere or you get nervous then it blocks the experience as you've seen already 90 to 95 percent of the people\n10:38 - have experienced my breath in your breath my life force because the force is the same the forces of divine i can relieve my force\n10:48 - because nothing holds it back i have no desire but your\n10:55 - evolution and progress i'm going to do it again keep the body relaxed drop the shoulders and when you're breathing normally\n11:16 - suppose your breath is like this when it gets a boost it lengthens or becomes stronger like to those who are receptive could you hear that could you hear what i did just\n11:28 - now the breath become wider so i am trying to stretch out to you and help you in your progress\n11:37 - evolution is done in the spine the life force energy and the breath move in the spine in kriya yoga so now we will do it once again [Music]\n11:49 - are you ready has anybody any questions those who are on heavy medication may not receive it and those who get nervous and suddenly startled or\n12:01 - overexcited they will not get it so you have to be totally relaxed sit feeling d not thinkingly just be totally relaxed and the moment i clap\n12:12 - your breath will lengthen ready breathe [Applause] very good tune into me now drop the mind and open the heart sit\n12:31 - feelingly ready i'm trying to teach you i'm not trying to impress you i'm trying to teach you that the moment the sound was indicated\n12:50 - by sound your breath became longer rich and deeper keep breathing the universal breath is one breath the breath of god [Applause]\n13:10 - [Applause] sit feelingly don't think just feel like when you're having a gelato you don't think you just enjoy it so enjoy the breath\n13:26 - the sound of my breath over the mic will lengthen your breath what do we do in this what am i trying to do i'm trying to unite humanity as one phenomenon\n13:43 - and if we unite humanity is one phenomena come unity humanity there will be peace on earth and goodwill to all humankind\n13:54 - so you have to cooperate in this this experiment this great process of love breathe with my breath [Applause]\n14:21 - and if you tune into me your breath will become longer richer and deeper to the degree of your attunement to the sound of breath that you hear [Applause]\n14:48 - relax open your eyes and relax now the second time of the people who didn't receive it last time and all of you who received it this\n15:02 - time better raise your hands excellent so you got the hang of it who didn't receive it after the second time raise your hands second time to who\n15:12 - didn't receive it even then everybody received it who didn't receive it okay so this is very good the purpose\n15:24 - of this movement is to tell the world why is there such hatred amongst the nations and the peoples of this earth\n15:36 - if we breathe one breath which i am demonstrating if there was no connection between you and me could i have breathed through you no\n15:46 - because there is a connection between humanity person to person we breathe through the other eye okay\n15:54 - so this is the message so the first gate for the initiation to kriya yoga has been opened tomorrow when you come to kriya yoga i've laid my life on the line\n16:07 - i breathed through your breath corrected your dna at the first level tomorrow i will try to give you my samadhi\n16:20 - you will share my samadhi i will give you my thought-free state of enlightened awareness this was a state of kundalini i gave you tomorrow i will give you the state of my\n16:32 - soul that is the state of our soul which is a thought-free state of profound tranquility thought-free state of profound peace which is the first state of\n16:45 - enlightenment now before this session comes to an end today my advice to you is take it on the high\n17:03 - many times you try to take it on the tide if you many of you been body surfing or not i don't know but body surfing it requires more skill\n17:12 - and is more difficult than board surfing and many times we try and the wave goes by us but sometimes when we try we catch the wave on our body and we go straight\n17:24 - so catch the wave at the right time don't miss an opportunity let not press precious moments slip by seek now the ultimate truth or soul sworn\n17:39 - spread your wings to fly immortal realms which death defy and so you will be the making of a perfect race a perfect you a perfect community in the days to come\n17:54 - of course it matters of course it matters it matters because it removes all irrelevant matter and takes you to spirit\n18:07 - because if you're in matter it wouldn't matter you know it's like like a sow a female pig\n18:16 - wallowing in the slush so man says hey pig come out i'll give you a better life so the pig says\n18:28 - no i'm happy wallowing in this crap so also there are higher beings than us who try to pick us out of our garbage\n18:40 - and say come on souls we take you some those to whom it doesn't matter who are steeped in matter of materialism don't make the effort\n18:50 - and those of you to whom it matters make it your life's purpose to remove the veil of matter and see the spirit of the lord that's how that's why matter matters\n19:07 - you have to make matter immaterial in your life towards spirit om namashibai and now with this\n19:24 - i have said what i have to say i have given you the experience of the breath to those who i have not because once i touch you with my breath\n19:34 - then i can work on the dna in the dreamweaver which i will be working at at shasta and when i visit in the night\n19:45 - i work on the evolution the dna to those who are receptive i cannot say which of you will be receptive to me when you sleep most of you will be and the work goes on\n19:56 - the good work the charming work the glorious work to see our lord the lord of a radiant splendor\n20:08 - who resides within and without us",

          "title": "The Blessing of Sitting Repeatedly in the Presence of the SatGuru",
          "transcript": "00:28 - being here and you are coming again and again it is the virtue the virtue of repetition shattered abhyas why a disciple must come in spite of learning all the techniques must come again and\n00:49 - again to the same master the same place and practice the same technique understand it is very important oh I practiced one lady came to me in America and she told me oh hello guru how are\n01:06 - you and this and that I said oh hello very fashionable lady and on so she had some she was smoking a long cigarette with some a bottle of glass of champagne and she said you know I've traveled the\n01:21 - world and I've been to all the Guru's in the world see when you cry when you go to the world they are good-hearted people they don't mean it bad they don't expect to be like you because you know\n01:35 - what is a guru parampara what is a dub what is respect because your mothers have taught you they have not been taught so it's okay if they put their leg one on top of the other and they\n01:48 - smoke and they talk to you well hallo guru how are you fine they say everybody is equal you know like they think everybody is it's it's a body culture she said you know I've been to all the\n02:03 - gurus practically in the world I've traveled the whole world and I've been to all the gurus and then I told her and you've learnt nothing because you have spent your time going\n02:19 - to the gurus and seeing what are they dress where do they come from what do they teach you have been inquiring but you have not cared to sit down and learn what they had to teach you and this is\n02:38 - your greatest shortcoming although you did it in innocence you have failed yourself you have failed yourself because you are not receptive here you have to be receptive even to\n02:53 - the to the till now you had not heard you had not heard the sound of the birds and I tell you silent and listen to the sounds and suddenly you'll hear many sounds of words\n03:16 - the sound was there from before but our mind should not open to it they were not receptive to it in this case of course you were receptive to the Guru but in her case it was not\n03:28 - receptive to the teachings of the Guru's so I said you have to open your mind we have about 300 species of different birds here in the aviary of of Sita Micah Dhara Sita my so the important\n03:47 - factor is why you should not go hedge-hopping from guru - guru and try to see what they have to teach one day about 20 people came to me so I said yes where are you from so he said\n04:12 - they said we are from of Duty Baba Shiva yogi he teaches in Bombay and he said if you want to go anywhere don't go any way if you want to go anywhere go to guru not ashram he holds you in very high\n04:26 - esteem and he says there's nothing else anywhere else if at all you're going to learn go take the darshan of the mercury shambling and sit at his feet and learn don't fidget and roam here and there so\n04:39 - he sent those people he himself had come about 10 15 years back he himself had taken their showing up there that time the shilling was not made I think oh maybe it was but what the Guru's advise\n04:52 - and what I advise wherever you go suppose you are a Jewish person then go to your synagogue and learn and meditate there this is because Akos are there so subsidies subsidies of joy if you learn\n05:08 - one then that one learning gives you the links of all the other knowledge --is that is very important because if you learn in the central channel your central channel is the Wikipedia of all\n05:29 - other branches of knowledge and nerves the Wikipedia's within you yourself you don't need to go out to other Wikipedia's and correct what they have to say and put all your own stuff in all\n05:42 - is within you all the knowledge of the world you need is within yourself all the medicine that you need is within your own medicine box of the endocrine system of glands and you have iodine and\n05:56 - you have all these these other things and you have to awaken the healing within you so the question is what is the virtue of coming again and again to the same master\n06:13 - to the same place and practice the same technique when you come to the same place again and again that that place becomes for you a Mundell Mundi the gate becomes for you\n06:38 - the Swarga doir and the stan becomes demanded and by your regular practice you become your own Ishta devatha Swarga doir mandir Orton Cody Asche toe is man there may be a way you're sitting in the\n06:57 - temple you become they shifted a visa and then you feel that there is no difference between the divine and you but if you keep changing your practice and keep changing the vibrations of it\n07:14 - and go to different places you cannot set the first thing is that in order for the spiritual plant within you to grow the spiritual Kundalini to awaken the spiritual plant to grow\n07:27 - you must not change your masters and your ston you must not change the soil that is the stand right and if you go to another place the main soil the spiritual soil which is given to you in\n07:52 - your practice is the Shiva Shakti on us and on in that spiritual soil your Kundalini energy takes on a certain momentum a certain pattern and a certain vibration if you practice another\n08:10 - technique that momentum pattern and vibration changes I do you understand I'm not saying go here and don't go there go anywhere but don't change the pattern and momentum then from there if\n08:26 - you go to another place still the pattern and momentum changes of your physical body your emotional body a mental body and your spiritual body which is the movement of Kundalini up\n08:35 - and down your spine that is the creme de la creme of practicing the same technique at the same place under the Guru Krupa the same master you understand so the technique\n08:47 - which you practice is like the motor vehicle it has the power it has the energy but it does not have the fuel of enlightenment you may have the best car Rolls Royce Mercedes but no petrol you\n09:07 - can't move so you may have the best techniques if you don't have guru Krupa then the your car will not move towards the gold you understand many people have carry mudra it is Sid\n09:19 - the technique is perfected right back 80 leg like a colleg a guru cut it I'm gonna the gutter guru baingan Hawaii this says bark hey tree look like a college a amrita that the Guru Ganga no\n09:37 - Hawaii if in the Umrah the cut in the in the top in your in your in your third ventricle the in that which is the Umbra the cut if there's no guru Gong guru K Ganga a hoagie Behati so then you okay\n09:50 - you you cannot be enlightened by kh3 mudra guru cut Umbra toretto guru Ganga no way back hey Chilly looking like a Cala gay I'm not a guru gonna Hawaii bus fancy kitchen chika catch a guru prana\n10:04 - Jimena Samui so it says you may do the Kriya a perfectly you may do the Kriya perfectly but if the guru Krupa is not guru pran guru Krupa in the form of pran is not\n10:17 - assisting your choise oprand if guru Chitina pran is not assisting your choise oprand then your crea ohm does not become successful therefore guru Krupa is the crux of it\n10:31 - all it is the creme de la creme rare or d'etre for success in Kriya yoga it is the chetana of the guru which makes your proud upon yet near Shiva Shakti honest and unsuccessful therefore it is\n10:47 - necessary for a place the person and the practice to be the same under the same guru the guidance of the Sadhguru is always important it is good if you practice your career techniques at home\n11:04 - anywhere in the world but it is even better if you can come once in a month once in three months or once in six months or once a year to the same master and rejuvenate renew and rejuvenate your\n11:17 - practice so that his Chaitanya the spark of his living ness may enliven your sadhna and transform you transform the matter in you to energy to emotions to devotion to love\n11:32 - to wisdom to divine consciousness this is the alchemy of the total transformation which is done by this the soul Chaitanya the light of the soul of the Satguru is that clear so this is the\n11:51 - virtue of coming to the same place practicing the same technique under the guidance of the same Sun guru om namah Shiva you also said something which says that\n12:10 - gurus on it their being in the Sun gurus Samadhi Samana you turn into Samadhi Samana because when you come in the presence of the master this Shiva his no mind state takes over you yes body says\n12:28 - so now in this case what happens that the Sadhguru here you have to imagine him from The Grocer state the Sadhguru is like a fountain he is he is emitting he's he's fountain ik he is found tuning\n12:50 - like a fountain sparks of light and these sparks of light create a whole magnetic field and within which you are drowned you are soaked and absorbed like a Rasha guna in the rush right so you\n13:07 - will be like a Rasha guna in the wrath of the Guru rasaan and but this depends on your mind if your mind is open and absorbs it then so each to the degree of his his attunement with the Guru each to\n13:23 - the degree of his his his achievement so the Guru is always in a state of own money I was the state of Samadhi if you tune in with him you will also become in a state of own money I was and Samadhi\n13:33 - some people will emotionally will absorb him at the Sadhguru at the emotional level some people will absorb the Sadhguru at the mental level some people will absorb\n13:42 - the Guru Satguru at the intuitional or some occulta samadhi level some will absorb the guru at the nirvikalpa samadhi level which is very rare but which can happen and that's why the Guru\n13:52 - says come share my Samadhi that's why it is important to repeatedly come in again to the and again to the same guru because you can share somebody and your evolution is quickened by leaps and\n14:04 - bounds by thousands of years your evolution is even if you don't like and even if you are in a bad mood come with all your emotional luggage come with all your stress come with all your tension\n14:17 - and dissolve it even if I'm not here I'm sitting here I will always be there this is the other important thing this is called Shiva path in the Shiva path that\n14:28 - has said for your students if any mind mind is you and consciousness as me okay let's think that if any mind of the disciple is attuned to an undifferentiated consciousness of the\n14:49 - master if any mind is attune to an undifferentiated consciousness then that mind that mind shall become that consciousness to the degree of its attunement with that consciousness got\n15:10 - it so you will become me to the extent of your Atma SOT with me haddad Mahajan eg the attunement with me Temari some veda and shelter here's some bathe and shelter your empathy this\n15:28 - actually happens if you try it now also you'll feel the peace you just have to relax it's easier to relax like this then like this or like this if if this is a challenge I'll see how the Guru can\n15:44 -

          "transcript": "00:13 - [Laughter] oh dear souls welcome to this full moon let us all have an\n00:33 - insightfulness towards this auspicious occasion of the full moon my blessings and goodwill are with you all today we shall\n00:49 - interact with the mind and the consciousness these two factors or other facts need to be understood very very\n01:02 - clearly in this blessing I am giving you I will be transmitting an awareness expanding energy as I talk within every word will be inherent to this energy which the\n01:18 - more advanced and sensitive of you will feel as my words hit your eard drums so that's a little bonanza and a present for you this full moon so the\n01:37 - bind is the phenomena which covers the consciousness which is the nomen the mind is always\n01:51 - dual and the consciousness is always single so the purpose of an insightful understanding into our own nature and\n02:07 - our own true being is to transform our mind to mindfulness and to transform our mindfulness\n02:27 - ness into soulfulness and ultimately to transform our soulfulness into divine consciousness this is the process of the\n02:47 - evolution from the mind to divine mind to divine soulfulness to divine consciousness you see so we are peeling the onions so to say the top layers of mind always\n03:11 - remember that mindfulness informs and soulfulness\n03:24 - transforms and consciousness is a teacher informs to mindful fulness a master\n03:42 - transforms to consciousness and this awakening which I'm giving you more than a teaching it is awakening you to the subtler layers of your being like\n03:59 - you peel the onion you peel the layers of your mind and to get you to subtler and subtler states of consciousness Now when we deal with the mind in the\n04:13 - beginning it's full of stray and random thoughts the idea is to collect these stray and random thoughts into a singular thought like we have a stray and random\n04:33 - thoughts i must run a few errands i must go to the market to buy my vegetables i must go to the school to fill the school fees and take the annual report of my\n04:50 - son the little son for I must sit and meditate at such and such a time on Lord Ram or the Christ whoever the deity is now these\n05:08 - are various thoughts I have to choose from these random thoughts which are called vitis random whirlpool vibrations of thoughts collect them and comb them into one\n05:24 - thought gradually lessen those thoughts one by one as I peel the first layer of mind you know it's a paradox the more you the lessen you uh the more you lessen the mind the more it\n05:39 - becomes full the more you peel the layers of mind the more the mind gets to a state of mind fullness because the mind is lessened of random thoughts urgent and\n05:54 - stray thoughts and filled with only one thought so ultimately when you get rid of the stray thoughts then you gradually get to a fewer thoughts you further concentrate\n06:06 - your mind you know on and fill it more and more with a singular thought till all the stray thoughts are eradicated from the mind and then you have one thought\n06:18 - of only the Christ or only therish Krishna this in yogic technical palance is called mindfulness but there's a further state of samy\n06:34 - where the subject and the object becomes one where mindfulness is there you are there and you're observing a still mind it is the mind and image of Christ and and and Ram\n06:50 - alone and nothing else this is called mindfulness but then there's a further stage where you do become that mindfulness you become the Lord Rama or you become the\n07:03 - Christ and you're so at onement with that thought with that mindfulness that you are the mindfulness you are Lord Ram you are Lord Krishna you are the Christ so that is the true meaning where this\n07:19 - word has picked up now and they are using it so I thought I should clarify this as to mindfulness means emptying of the random thoughts emptying of the the urgent thoughts and filling it with one\n07:30 - thought and your mind is filled so much with that one thought that there is no place for it to move it is full that is mindfulness means total concentration when you achieve the faculty of\n07:45 - exclusive attention you are in mindfulness that is a further stage of this is you become that mindfulness you become the object sum yum so this is very very important to\n08:01 - have this state of mindfulness but when you see the Christ or you see the essence of Lord Ram the essence of God in the image of Ram or the essence of God in the image\n08:15 - of Christ you are still seeing God through your mind in order to see God as he is you must get to a further state of soulfulness so\n08:32 - technically mindfulness will be seeing one object mindfulness was will be filling your mind with only one object so it's full and is not able to move anywhere\n08:47 - else filling yourself with the one object of Christ or the or Ram but then when you go to soulfulness you have to undergo a process of transformation where by repetitive\n09:01 - practice of mindfulness a transformation takes place by rhythmic breathing and then stilling that breath the so you soulfulness when you get to soulfulness that is called syamy soulfulness is samy\n09:19 - and when you get to soulfulness you become that mindfulness that means when you're concentrating on Christ or Ram and your mind is not moving from that image it is full of your mind is filled\n09:34 - with the image of the Christ or the or Krishna or Ram then you are mindful mindfulness but when you concentrate deeper and further and you become that very image of Christ or Lord Ram then\n09:45 - you are soulfulness you have transformed itself into the figure of Christ or Ram you are still in a state from mindfulness to divine mind which is called\n09:58 - soulfulness do you understand so soulfulness is a more advanced stage of the uh the mindfulness so mindfulness informs it is mental it's a process of concentration mindfulness informs and\n10:17 - soulfulness transforms and the first and the last and higher stages divine consciousness is it doesn't inform or transform it just\n10:33 - is got it okay then keep it let it sink in okay so now getting to this transformative stage of soulfulness you are what you meditate on\n10:51 - you are you are what you mindfulness on that is Samy soulfulness is Samy then you have to get to a further stage after you have got to this stage\n11:05 - which is a very lofty stage the stage of soulfulness although it is in relativity it is still seeing the divine essence through the divine\n11:22 - mind through the divine soul the soul is just a deeper and more [Music] experiential state of awareness than mindfulness\n11:40 - but now seeing the supreme reality through soulfulness which is the divine mind we want to see God not through soulfulness or divine mind but we want\n11:57 - to see the supreme reality not through soulfulness or divine mind but we want to see the supreme reality as it is and here's the next\n12:13 - process where all your thoughts are stilled but they are still the one singular particle in creation the one singular electron in creation you have transformed your mind into the one\n12:31 - singular electron it is a particle but you have to free that particle you see from the molecular stage of uh the mind you went to the\n12:46 - atomic stage of mindfulness you went to the subatomic stage of the the soulfulness okay the electronic stage of the divine mind but now the\n13:05 - electron has to be transcended even the divine mind or the state of soulfulness the bearer of truth it's known\n13:19 - as where the mind is universal and pure and it reflects the truth of the universe within it [Music] that is the crystal clear mind of the\n13:44 - universe where in your individual mind you can grasp and comprehend the the universal mind of the far limits of the mind and matter of nature and you tend to realize and be\n13:57 - aware there in every atom of creation and know that all this is me i am that I am a I am that I am but this stage two of realizing the\n14:15 - divine supreme reality is through the divine mind now we have to transcend or you can say this soulfulness is a state of perfect sabikalpa\n14:28 - samadhi but we have to get to consciousness from soulfulness or divine mind we have to transcend it dissolve the divine mind you know like you take a cube of\n14:44 - sugar it's perfectly uniform sugar the divine mind and put it in a cup of tea just like sugar dissolves a cube of sugar dissolves in a cup of tea so you must be able to by incessant practice\n14:58 - dissolve the cube of sugar of soulfulness and divine mind into the cup of tea of uh divine consciousness so now the consciousness this process is the\n15:11 - piercing of the stargate the passing through the state of soulfulness or divine mind into the state superernal undescribable state of divine consciousness because remember till\n15:25 - divine mind you're being informed of all the information you're seeing god but through the mirror of the mind through the mirror but we have to break that mirror we have to dissolve it or\n15:37 - transcend send it whatever to get to the state of God as is and he is called the indescribable divine consciousness consciousness unqualified for which we actually have\n15:52 - no name I'm using the word divine consciousness the transition from divine mind to divine consciousness by is done by penetrating the stargate where the whole of the divine mind where the whole\n16:04 - of soulfulness appears to view as the stargate as a divine star in the third eye that is the soulfulness from mindfulness to soulfulness and when you pass from\n16:16 - soulfulness you have to pass through the gates of the star follow the way of the purple star of the east they say so when you when you do that you cannot try to pass\n16:28 - through that because trying itself is a desire and an obstacle if you try you don't go through the stargate because you are trying it's a desire if you don't try you don't move towards\n16:40 - stargate because you don't try so here's the catch 22 the dichotomy is if you don't try you don't you don't go through stargate and if you try it being a desire effort you don't\n16:53 - go through stargate so then what to do die die the last word die is death of not your ordinary\n17:08 - ego but the death of a much finer state which cannot be called the ego or existence because you passed it already when you passed mindfulness into soulfulness you have destroyed your\n17:21 - personal egoism or egotistic qualities but this is a vaster knowingness of matter as is of the far limits of the mind and matter of the universe you have gained the knowledge\n17:35 - of the limits of the universe now you have to transcend this knowledge this knowingness this faint awareness this faint awareness that I know so even this awareness of knowing\n17:49 - without any pride without any holding or attitude even this simple knowingness has to be trans transcended so you die unto the divine to the supreme reality you call God or Ishwar or Allah whatever\n18:05 - when you surrender and die when you obliterate the feeling of the desire for God the desire for knowing God the desire for even not knowing God when\n18:22 - these feelings are and desires are eliminated from your inherent consciousness that consciousness is released because when you relieve from that even\n18:37 - the soulful consciousness the soulfulness releases the consciousness and by the grace of the divine lord or the divine sguru who is a representative of the lord you\n18:52 - can pass through the stargate from divine mind of soulfulness to divine consciousness of supreme reality so here is your journey\n19:07 - from the scattered mind the day-to-day scattered mind to mindfulness which is a concentrated mind to soulfulness which is an absorbed mind the mind absorbed in divinity\n19:24 - through that divine mind because the divine mind becomes so pure that it becomes almost as pure as the consciousness and therefore it's known as\n19:35 - soulfulness a highly purified highly highly purified mindfulness is soulfulness and a very very purified soulfulness extremely almost transforming itself into Divine\n19:51 - consciousness is what is required for your inate innate purush the atma purush or your divine consciousness which is ensconced or ensoldled within the soulfulness is\n20:07 - insold the spirit of Lord the Lord which is divine consciousness and that passes through Stargate and then you have transcended the soulfulness of divine mind into the isness of divine\n20:24 - consciousness and therefore divine consciousness cannot be told those who tell it know it not and those who know it tell it not but those who know it tell it not but can definitely through\n20:37 - an experience give you a glimpse of that indescribable ineffable reality which passes all understanding this is the p passing of the stargate and your journey the\n20:53 - journey of your soul consciousness to merge in the superconsciousness of the divine and therefore remember that mindfulness informs soulfulness\n21:12 - transforms and consciousness is with this all my blessings to you for the new moon i just speak this guy is just speaking at random to you guys i\n21:24 - don't know whether I make sense or you make sense but since I've totally surrendered to the divine almighty he speaks through me what he likes to speak this is a light talk maybe for you\n21:36 - because your minds get still and with this my blessings to you god speed and God bless [Music]\n21:52 - Nanjani how",

blah blah blah blah chatter chatter he takes a bit of time to take you straight into a trance some of these strands like what Francis of Assisi used to go into there is new menus to go into you heard\n00:45 - of the person David Thoreau Thoreau who sort of Thoreau he was an American saint and here he is predominant part of approach was through devotion devotion and emotions Emerson\n01:03 - was sort of raise your hands and who's sort of who's heard of various Newman Newman three snowmen okay it's all very well read people who said of Krishna the one with the flute the Chama the Lord\n01:29 - okay so you're sitting too much to the side you may not be able to see what is to be seen the people at the back will of course get the best view of everything to be seen here because it's\n01:44 - a picture show in time and be taking in a smooth travel maybe back to the future future behind you'd have to see that now I want you all to relax and tune in that's not a good place at all that's\n02:01 - that is not a good place at all you may miss out on a transmission nobody spitters sit in any special place or something sit with the group so you can see what's happening in front don't\n02:15 - sit too much to the side the auras are going to be seen the colors are going to be seen I have to give you just an introduction not that I'm suggesting so first\n02:26 - I'm gonna share with you the universal soul consciousness and many people ask me do not you always say that normal people live in a bedlam of misery created by their own thoughts people\n02:49 - live in a bedlam of misery a chaos created by their own thoughts they may be the most organized people in corporates you know maybe the big Charles Schwab or Merrill Lynch or\n03:09 - Microsoft or Intel but they're random minds are chaos it's a confusion very organized for that moment of time which is good but the mind don't must always be under your control this is very\n03:25 - important so today I'll handle your minds for a moment I'll not only control my mind but I can control yours too but if you go home and try to control your own mind your mind will make a ragdoll\n03:39 - out of you and throw you out of the window it'll say it's a mind be quiet they say shut up I'll think what I like oh I can't because you cannot control the mind so yeah I am here to serve you\n03:54 -

comes and starts well have a relaxed mind drop all inhibition be relaxed and free and and sit feelingly I want you to settle down I'm giving you some time and I'd like you all to be very relaxed\n04:54 - don't be tense at all so I'm just gonna come amongst your land that you it's my other you you want to see more aspects of myself than my physical body I'm going to extend my astral and my\n05:07 - spiritual self to you okay is that right and but man is sectorally his physical passional emotional devotional then then he is a intuitional okay and then his spiritual so there's seven layers so the\n05:28 - higher layers I'm going to just go by you and introduce myself to you at a higher level of spiritual consciousness so my spiritual consciousness will touch you it'll touch you automatically I want\n05:40 - you to be relaxed I'm not claiming to do anything I'm just serving you I want you to be open that's all be totally relaxed I know you all all great guys so good beep totally relaxed okay all people be\n06:04 -

of mind to get to the goddess ins lying at the core of one's own being yolk is brought about and made successful by up the house and Vairagya the meaning of Appius is to move towards the goal with\n00:58 - intensity towards God unruffled by emotions or outward distractions Vairagya means non attachment to the objects of the five senses abuse assists in the cultivation of vairagya on a\n01:18 - pilgrimage to the divine to the superconscious states of yolk three factors are necessary for the successful journey they are perseverance in yoke unruffled emotions and reverence for the\n01:32 - practice the brave yogi has embarked on a journey to the holy of holies from which the sacredness of all pilgrimages is derived in the high states of yo he treads the sacred ground of ever more\n01:48 - refined spheres of consciousness as he nears the temple of samadhi in which his deity is enshrined when we consider the state of Samadhi we must be aware of the fact that this technique is not only the\n02:04 - higher form of yoga but its very essence a great rishi the asks stated yoga Samadhi meaning Yoga is Samadhi it becomes necessary to point out here that there is a widely prevalent\n02:24 - misconception in the West regarding the nature and purpose of you a person practicing asanas and postural integration to improve his health says he is practicing yoga it's true that\n02:42 - people in innocent ignorance vulgarize yoke since a practice of asin's and postures does not constitute the real practice of yoke an individual can master all the 84,000 Arsenal's without\n02:57 - having a ghost of an idea about the true yoke on the other hand a yogi can practice the real yoke of samadhi without doing any asin's so the physical postures alone only qualify a student to\n03:13 - say he practises asin's to prepare for yoke another widely held and prevalent misconception is the one about diet it's true that we need pure and sattvic food to put the body into the required state\n03:32 - of harmony but the practice of yoke many people in India have achiely live on a diet of rice curds vegetables and fruits which are sattvic so they might as well claim that they are practicing yoke to\n03:47 - diet this is not the complete picture the proper understanding is that both postures and diet are supportive to attaining the superconscious states of yoga but do not in themselves constitute\n04:01 - yoke proper there is no doubt that Samadhi the superconscious states are the essential pathways of peace and yoke they must be practiced with proper preparation and prolonged graduated\n04:18 - training there are a number of scientific techniques integrated into a systematic but elastic course of discipline a serious student of yoga but follow these time tried methods with the\n04:33 - determination to reach the goal no matter what the temporary difficulty is encountered or the number of lives it may take to reach the final MOX this is not to be confused with easy\n04:47 - shortcut methods given by pseudo yoga teachers to attract huge masses of followers one of the most critical factors to be cautious of is to know the difference between the psychic state of\n05:03 - France and the enlightened state of Samadhi when a person emerges from the superconscious state of Samadhi he is aglow with the wisdom of the guards but\n05:14 - he has touched the feet of the Lord is far Mothma when a person comes out of a trance induced by other methods he goes to the lower mental and astral planes without receiving any knowledge he is\n05:29 - the same as he was before in the 19th and 20th centuries when yoke was introduced to the West but lack of a better word trance was used to explain Samadhi this led to a lot of confusion\n05:45 - because all psychics in France were happy to be co-equal to the Buddha but later they were put in their proper places when their psychic state of trance was explained to them Patanjali\n06:03 - is Raja yoga and babaji's Kriya yoga everything comes to him makes the utmost effort under the circumstances in which he has been placed as Reath the underlying order of the unfolding\n06:20 - universe brings to each individual the external yoke consists of yeungnam asana pranayama and pratyahara their function is to prepare the yogi for the internal yoke which deals with the mind and\n06:40 - comprises three techniques Ahana de Haan and Samadhi number one YUM deals with the elimination of lower desires and emotions it exercises model percepts such as non-violence\n07:00 - truthfulness non-stealing sexual abstinence and non attachment to neom provides the disciplined ground for yoke this builds character so essential for success in yoke the five virtues to be\n07:22 - practiced are purity and body and thought contentment self-discipline top meditation swati eye and surrender to one's divine indweller ishvara Nathon three asan possible integration\n07:47 - eliminates disturbance to the mind caused by the body by making the body a fit instrument to progress in yoke Oh pranayama life force control eliminates disturbances caused by the three humors\n08:08 - in the pranic body gives control of the currents of pran and upon which automatically makes bharata ha happen five protea ha reversal of the life force energy pran eliminates\n08:32 - disturbances coming through the sense organs by introvert in the prawn in the spine which gets magnetized cutting off the five cents telephones from external objects a yogi in prot their heart is\n08:46 - like a tortoise retracting its limbs into its shell reference go Raksha patottie chapter 2 verse 24 6 karna concentration but the mind left alone undisturbed by outer distractions yet\n09:09 - filled with desires and they're stored impressions it becomes necessary to eliminate them by concentration the merger of concentration into meditation is as natural as the flower becoming the\n09:24 - fruit seven day on meditation as the conscious state of meditation becomes more and more refined the desires and they're stored impressions meaning sounds scars weaken and lose their hold\n09:46 - then a flowing state of awareness tones that gradually transforms into expanded states of Samadhi eighth Samadhi super conscious states of awareness they are broadly some pregnat Samadhi a\n10:07 - sampragnata samadhi near beach Samadhi and Dharma makes Samadhi then the Yogi's consciousness expands into the truth of his infinite self called neurons and nerve are prominent one or Cavalia all\n10:33 - been the same the process of the Harned Yun and Samadhi flow and flower into one another these are three continuing stages of the same mental process they differ in degree and not in kind the\n10:53 - fusion of the three phases in their totality is called somnium meaning becoming the object when a yogi takes an object in manifestation and applies the Harned yun and samadhi to it until the\n11:08 - reality hidden within the object is revealed he is said to have performed samyama kriya yoga a pran upon yoga this is the sacred fire ceremony of the yogi whereby\n11:28 - he offers the oblations of pranic breath into a banach breath and vice-versa to equalize the to life currents and enter the state of cave li samadhi there never has been nor will be a time\n11:46 - when man's own nature shall cease to demand his best and foremost attention the science of yoke commends itself to the foremost minds of East and West so vital is this inner science for the\n12:00 - evolution of consciousness that besides it the greatest of human achievements pale into insignificance the science of Kriya yoga pranayama offers the inhaled pranic breath into the exhaled upon ik\n12:15 - breath and vice versa by this process the yogi neutralizes the to life currents of pran and upon this results in the arresting of decay and growth in the body this is done by rejuvenating\n12:30 - the blood and body cells with life energy called pran that has been distilled from the breath and moved into the spine and the brain the Kriya yoga arrests all bodily decay thereby\n12:45 - quieting the breath and heart this renders the purifying action of the breath and heart unnecessary as they gradually slow down through persevering practice the Bhagavad Gita mentions the\n13:05 - science of Kriya yoga in chapter 4 verse 29 the Kriya yoga pranayama called the prana panic fire right by the yogis teaches man to untie the court of breath that binds our soul to the bodily cage\n13:21 - the soul is then released fly and expand into the superconscious skies of omnipresent spirit and come back at will into the little body cage no flight of fancy is this but a true experiencing of\n13:36 - divine bliss pranayama is derived from its sanskrit roots brawn meaning life and ayah means control so pranayama is therefore life control and not breath control in the larger sense the whole\n13:54 - world is filled with the universal life force energy called pran everything is a differentiation of the modes of expression of this universal force therefore Universal pran is para\n14:10 - property pure nature this eminent energy is derived from the infinite spirit and permeates and sustains the universe individual pran is an intelligent force but has no consciousness in the\n14:30 - empirical or transcendental sense the soul is the conscious unit and pran is its basis the consciousness through mind ego dictates terms and pran follows the dictate neither Crossley material nor\n14:47 - purely spiritual pran borrows from the soul its power of activating the body there are two main life currents in the body one is that of pran which flows from the coccyx to the point between the\n15:02 - eyebrows the nature of this life current is soothing it introverts the devotees attention during sleep and the wakeful state and in meditation unites the soul with the spirit in the third ventricle\n15:15 - of the brain called the Shivani through or third eye the other main current is that of upon which flows from the third eye to the coccyx this downward flowing extroverted current this\n15:30 - tributes itself through the coccyx Center to the motor sensory nerves it keeps man's consciousness delusive li tied to the body the upon current is restless and engrosses man in sensory\n15:43 - experiences quote from the bhagavad gita chapter 6 verse 46 greater is the yogi than body disciplining ascetics greater even than the followers of wisdoms path greater than the path of action\n16:01 - be thou Arjun a yogi Priya o pranayaam arrests partly decayed connected with upon manifesting in the exhaled breath by fresh in elations of lifeforce pran distilled from the inhaled breath this\n16:21 - pran enables the devotee to do away with the illusion of decay and mutation he then realizes that his body is made of life fronds of congealed light the body of the Kriya yogi is recharged with\n16:36 - extra energy distilled from the breath and energized by the tremendous dynamo of energy generated in the spine the decay of body tissues decreases this ultimately makes unnecessary the blood\n16:52 - cleansing function of the heart the heart pump becomes quiet going to the non pumping of Venice blood and exhalation and inhalation of breath are evened out the life energy unites in the\n17:05 - current in the spine the light of pure pran scintillates from the six chakras to all the bodily cells keeping them in a spiritually magnetized condition Kriya Yoga is referred to obliquely\n17:20 - in yoga treat rises as gave Lee prana or cave aleikum buck this is the true prana that has transcended the necessity for inhalation pure ik and exhalation richer breath is transmitted into inner life\n17:37 -

yolk cave Lee prana is not as explicit or as specific as Kriya Yoga is and techniques expounded by Shiv goraksha babaji the Lord surrounded man's soul first with an idea body then he encased\n18:56 - the idea body with a very subtle light the astral body a third of final encasement was the electro atomic dream body the illusion of a fleshy form port the Gita page 306 volume 1 / Nancy\n19:16 - Yogananda the bhagavad-gita advises us to practice pranayama life force control to enable us to realize that we are not made of flesh but of lifeforce condensed from the thought of God priya is a\n19:36 - process of converting breath into life force and realizing the body is liked by the perfect performance of Kriya 1728 times in one posture that is at one time and by practicing a total of\n19:54 - twenty thousand seven hundred and thirty six crias a devotee can reach a state of Samadhi got contact but Korea cannot be practiced so many times by a beginner when the body and mind of the yogi are\n20:09 - prepared to accommodate the high voltage of so much Kriya yoga his guru will advise him that he is ready for the experience of Samadhi if the Koreas are broken into several\n20:21 - sittings there is no harm it will just take longer Kundalini Kriya yoga Kundalini is the electromagnetic pranic energy which means coiled spiral and stems from an earlier route kun meaning\n20:41 - fire pit it is coiled three-and-a-half times around the base of the spine Kundalini is represented by a cobra snake and can move a yogi from static state to kinetic\n20:54 - activation in a split second the Kundalini is intensified spiritual pran if the pranic energy is the atomic bomb the voltage of the Kundalini energy benefits the guided yogi like the\n21:08 -

the Kundalini breath or Kundalini Kriya yoga it is hidden and latent within all human beings in their nervous system when the Kriya yoga pranayama is performed as per the sadguru's guidance\n21:39 - the pranic life force in your spinal cord builds up to generate a great spiritual magnetism and voltage by the ceaseless movement of the Kriya lifeforce breath once pran breath vital\n21:54 -

          "title": "Anusthan - The Virtue of Repetition",
          "transcript": "00:08 - the virtue the virtue of repetition satan why a disciple must come in spite of learning all the techniques\n00:21 - must come again and again to the same master the same place and practice the same technique anusthan\n00:31 - it is very important one lady came to me in america and she told me oh hello guru how are you and they said that i said oh hello very fashionable lady and\n00:42 - so she had some she was smoking a long cigarette with some a bottle of a glass of champagne and she said you know i've traveled the the world\n00:55 - and i've been to all the gurus in the world see when you cross when you go to the world they are good-hearted people they don't mean it bad they don't expect to\n01:05 - be like you because you know what is a guru parampara what is what is respect because your mothers have taught you they have not been taught so it's okay\n01:16 - if they put their leg one on top of the other and they smoke and they talk to you well hello guru how are you fine\n01:24 - they say everybody is equal you know like they think everybody is it's it's a buddy culture she said you know i've been to all the gurus practically in the world\n01:37 - i've traveled the whole world and i've been to all the gurus and then i told her and you've learnt nothing because\n01:49 - you have spent your time going to the gurus and seeing what are their dress where do they come from\n01:58 - what do they teach you have been inquiring but you have not cared to sit down and learn what they had to teach you\n02:09 - and this is your greatest shortcoming although you did it in innocence you have failed yourself you have failed yourself\n02:20 - because you are not receptive till now you had not heard you had not heard the sound of the birds and i tell you silent and listen to the\n02:30 - sounds and suddenly you'll hear many sounds of words the sound was there from before but our minds were not open to it they were not receptive to it\n02:50 - in this case of course you were receptive to the guru but in her case it was not receptive to the teachings of the gurus so i said you have to open your mind\n02:58 - we have about 300 species of different birds here in the aviary of of sita my kadara sitamai so\n03:12 - the important factor is why you should not go hedgehopping from guru to guru and try to see what they have to teach\n03:30 - one day about 20 people came to me so i said yes where are you from so he said they said we are from abdut baba\n03:42 - shiva yogi he teaches in bombash and he said if you want to go anywhere don't go anywhere if you want to go anywhere go to guru natal's ashram he holds you in very high esteem and he\n03:53 - says there's nothing else anywhere else if at all you're going to learn go take the darshan of the mercury shivling and sit at his feet and learn don't fidget and roam here and there so\n04:05 - he sent those people he himself had come about 10 15 years back he himself had taken darshan up there that time the shivling was not made i think or maybe it was but\n04:17 - what the guru's advice and what i advise wherever you go suppose you are a jewish person then go to your synagogue and learn and meditate there\n04:28 - this is because if you learn one then that one learning gives you the links of all the\n04:41 - other knowledges that is very important because if you learn in the central channel your central channel is the wikipedia of\n04:54 - all other branches of knowledge and nerves the wikipedias within you yourself you don't need to go out to other wikipedias and correct what they have to\n05:06 - say and put all your own stuff in all is within you all the knowledge you of the world you need is within yourself all the medicine that you need is within your own medicine box\n05:17 - of the endocrine system of glands and you have id and you have all these these other things and you have to awaken the healing within you so the question is\n05:30 - what is the virtue of coming again and again to the same master to the same place and practice the same technique\n05:46 - when you come to the same place again and again that that place becomes for you a mandir mandir\n06:02 - the gate becomes for you the swarga dwarf and the pakistan becomes the mandir and by your regular practice you become your own ishta devda\n06:18 - swargadwar mandir and then you feel that there is no difference between the divine and you but if you keep changing your practice and keep changing the vibrations of it\n06:39 - and go to different places you cannot set the first thing is that in order for the spiritual plant within you to grow the spiritual kundalini to awaken the\n06:51 - spiritual plant to grow you must not change your masters and your stan you must not change the soil you must not change the soil that is the stan\n07:06 - right and if you go to another place the main soil the spiritual soil which is given to you in your\n07:18 - practice is the shiva shakti in that spiritual soil your kundalini energy takes on a certain\n07:31 - momentum a certain pattern and a certain vibration if you practice another technique that momentum pattern and vibration changes i do you understand\n07:46 - i'm not saying go here and don't go there go anywhere but don't change the pattern and momentum then from there if you go to another place still the pattern and momentum changes\n07:55 - of your physical body your emotional body your mental body and your spiritual body which is the movement of kundalini up and down your spine that is the creme de la creme\n08:04 - of practicing the same technique at the same place under the guru krupa the same master do you understand so the technique which you practice\n08:15 - is like the motor vehicle it has the power it has the energy but it does not have the fuel of enlightenment\n08:29 - you may have the best car rolls royce mercedes but no petrol you can't move so you may have the best techniques if you don't have guru krupa then the your car will not move towards\n08:40 - the goal do you understand many people have kcra mudra it is sid the technique is perfected right in your third ventricle\n09:09 - that which is the amrita gut if there's no guru gang guru ganga nay hogi bhati so then you cannot be enlightened by keturi mudra\n09:20 - guru ghat you may do the kriya perfectly but if the guru krupa is not guru prad guru krupa in the form of prana is not assisting your schwa sopran if guru\n09:46 - chaitanya prana is not assisting your schwa prand then your kriya yoga does not become successful therefore guru krupa is the crux of it all it is the creme de\n09:58 - la creme resort for success in kriya yoga it is the caitanya of the guru which makes your praanapan yadiya shiva shaktiyanu sandhan successful\n10:12 - therefore it is necessary for a place the person and the practice to be the same under the same guru\n10:24 - the guidance of the sadhguru is always important it is good if you practice your career techniques at home anywhere in the world but it is even better if you can come\n10:34 - once in a month once in three months or once in six months or once a year to the same master and rejuvenate renew and rejuvenate your practice so that his chaitanya the spark of his livingness\n10:48 - may enliven your sadhana and transform you transform the matter in you to energy to emotions to devotion to love\n10:59 - to wisdom to divine consciousness this is the alchemy of the total transformation which is done by the the soul chaitanya the light of the soul\n11:12 - of the satguru is that clear so this is the virtue of coming to the same place practicing the same technique under the guidance of the same sadhguru\n11:26 - om namashiva you also said something which says that being in the sanity of the guru is samadhi saman\n11:46 - [Applause] takes over you yes and once you get into that state in which he is the decay of your body says stop\n11:55 - now in this case what happens that the satguru here you have to imagine him from the grossest state the satguru is like a fountain he is\n12:07 - he is emitting his his fountaining he is fountaining like a fountain\n12:18 - sparks of light and these sparks of light create a whole magnetic field and within which you are drowned you are soaked and absorbed like a rashogulla in the rash\n12:31 - right so you will be like a rasha gullah in the rest of the guru but this depends on your mind if your mind is open and absorbs it then so each\n12:45 - to the degree of his his attunement with the guru each to the degree of his his attunement so the guru is always in a state of unmania was the state of\n12:54 - samadhi if you tune in with him you will also become in a state of unmania and samadhi some people will emotionally will absorb him at the satguru at the emotional\n13:03 - level some people will absorb the satguru at the mental level some people will absorb the guru satguru at the intuitional or sabikal samadhi level some will absorb the guru at the\n13:14 - nirvikalp samadhi level which is very rare but which can happen and that's why the guru says come share my samadhi that's why it is important to repeatedly come in again to the and again to the\n13:24 - same guru because you can share his samadhi and your evolution is quickened by leaps and bounds by thousands of years your evolution is even if you don't like it even if you\n13:35 - are in a bad mood come with all your emotional luggage come with all your stress come with all your attention and i will dissolve it even if i'm not here i'm sitting here\n13:46 - i will always be there this is the other important thing this is called shiva path in the shiva path it is said for your students\n13:56 - if any mind mind is you and consciousness is me okay let's think that if any mind of the disciple\n14:09 - is attuned to an undifferentiated consciousness of the master if any mind is attuned to an undifferentiated consciousness then that\n14:22 - mind that mind shall become that consciousness to the degree of its attunement with that consciousness\n14:35 - got it so you will become me to the extent of your this actually happens if you try it now also you'll feel the peace\n14:57 - you just have to relax it's easier to relax like this than like this or like this if this is a challenge i'll see how the\n15:10 - guru can affect me is giving no transmission then of course who's interested in giving you a transmission you stick your left shoulder out and say it's not challenger\n15:24 - so some people do that in the west they go and test you and they say ok it's not a challenge it is i am a server of humanity and i\n15:39 - have come to serve you as a servant of humanity accept the service and transform yourself now the second thing why even after the disciple has received\n15:51 - received all his six kriyas or 36 kriyas now as the new age people say the six kriyas after having been received why you must still come\n16:02 - to the same stan to the same ashram and the same satguru even after you us have received your techniques and are practicing them the sadhguru is still\n16:14 - by his spiritual vibrations by his kundalini shaktipat the energy transmitted from his kundalini shakti he works on all your chakras on every\n16:26 - chakra of your being within the chakras are lodged your dna he can transform your negative dna he can transform your negative system he can eliminate your emotions\n16:41 - which are suffering the suffering of your emotions is eliminated by him your stress is relieved that is what is done\n16:53 - by sitting repeatedly in the presence of the sadhguru any questions you can see when a person is stressed by\n17:13 - their behavior you see when a person has more responsibilities usually he is stressed because his mind has been tuned and geared you know his uh what has happened\n17:23 - if a fellow suddenly comes from fighting in the like maharana uday saying if he's suddenly fighting in this he also meditates because sunny comes after a battle\n17:33 - and he sits here you'll always see he'll be doing like this not that he's a bad meditator he's good but his parasympathetics nervous system\n17:45 - his alert systems have been geared so much the adrenaline fight flight mechanism is so charged that it will take him two or three days to calm down and on the third day he'll be sitting\n17:56 - like this ultimately when i surrender not when i do it from ego when i surrender you are the karta karvita\n18:34 - so ultimately the good job which is done the ego sometimes has a satyayam car and it feels it is doing it but it is the good lord doing it so when your body language is a little tense and your\n18:46 - fidgety that means you have a lot of responsibility on you something else is weighing on your mind you know the mind is so tricky something else is\n18:57 - many times it so happens i'll tell you with me what happens i go into my states of samadhi regularly i'm dissolving in my highest samadhi but sometimes when\n19:08 - i'm in a mood then i have not seen my grandchildren so then suddenly before i go into that i'm doing my kriya and after kriya when before going to parvas i said no\n19:18 - i get up i go to the pastry store then i buy all the cakes for my grandchildren i must finish that\n19:28 - that's at the back of my head let me get it done with and then you get the cakes or the pizzas the cheeseburgers pizzas you know there's a new pizza which is cheese\n19:38 - burst i'm very in high tech with us because i have grandchildren and they get all these things and some italian people who get it ordered\n19:46 - like alexandra orders it burst and we are bursting with cheese so then we have this and we have the cakes and all then we are shanti shanti then in the then in the evening i can go\n19:58 - and meditate and do so when it happens with me i am a grahasti satguru in a grass i have my responsibilities my all my sons and my grandsons know\n20:11 - that as far as family life is concerned vivah is concerned i know nothing i'm a zero\n20:22 - they know it but because of respect they don't say it [Laughter] old man has mucked it up he's messed it up there he's gone to this house he was\n20:30 - supposed to come here so many times misunderstanding with the grandchildren and they said there's a huge and the grandchildren are not bothered and i'm not bothered\n20:38 - the parents are bothered some protocol mess up or something prabhupada you see ultimately we have to go in two days not you are\n20:54 - you are doing kriya yoga you cannot go so easily unless you get darshan because now you have hooked god with the practice of your kriya yoga you\n21:05 - have hooked the sadhguru you are coming again and again you are deserving something much more in the fundamental truth of life which has nothing to do with the relative truth\n21:18 - no man is perfect enough in relativity to judge another man through a zigzag vision relativity is vision is all zigzag and unless you're perfect you cannot you\n21:29 - you cannot be a judge over another person do you understand the zigzag vision of relativity does not allow you\n21:39 - to be a judge over another person no man until he is perfect can judge another man god is the only judge his dispensation comes through the law\n21:51 - of karma finished he is the perfect judge what he has dispensed through the law of retribution the\n22:00 - karmic law repaired by going against the fundamental philosophy the great sages and the masters the\n22:25 - great philosophy of sankhya yoga who says only something can come out of something nothing cannot come out of something cannot come out of nothing but god is god\n22:36 - he can make something come out of nothing that's why god is god that's why he can do the impossible that he doesn't do it to keep his own law in order is a different question but\n22:46 - don't limit his impossibility don't limit the uniqueness of the lord god have full faith nothing is impossible for him and we who are attached to him by a single\n22:60 - thread of breath shiva we will also be saved in his love and his compassion\n23:10 - but for that you must have only one string don't start pulling many strings all of them will break make it stronger and stronger and stronger and then climb\n23:18 - up as the string as the spider's web becomes into a thicker rope you can climb your way right to the top\n23:29 - and meet your divine lord i so that is the virtue of repetition the virtue of repeated coming to the same satguru\n23:41 - the same sadhana and the same stan sadhguru you",

receptive here you have to be receptive even to the to the till now you had not heard you had not heard the sound of the birds and I tell you silent and listen\n02:50 - to the sounds and suddenly you'll hear many sounds of birds the sound was there from before but our minds were not open to it they were not\n03:08 - receptive to it in this case of course you were receptive to the guru but in her case it was not receptive to the teachings of the gurus so I said you have to open your mind we have about 300\n03:19 - species of different birds here in the aary of of sit Kadar sitam so the important factor is why you should not go hedg hopping from Guru to\n03:38 - Guru and try to see what they have to teach one day about 20 people came to me so I said yes where are you from so he said they said we are from ABD Baba shiv\n04:02 - Yogi he teaches in bomes and he said if you want to go anywhere don't go anywhere if you want to go anywhere go to gurunath asham he holds you in very high esteem and he says there's nothing\n04:14 - else anywhere else if at all you're going to learn go take the d of the Mercury shivling and sit at his feet and learn don't fidget and Drome here and there so he sent those people he himself\n04:27 - had come about 10 15 years back he himself self had taken D up there that time the shivling was not made I think or maybe it was but uh what the guru's advice and what I advise wherever you go\n04:41 - suppose you are a Jewish person then go to your synagogue and learn and meditate there this is because if you learn one then that one learning gives you the\n04:58 - links of all the other knowledges that is very important because if you learn in the central Channel your central channel is the\n05:12 - Wikipedia of all other branches of knowledge and nerves the Wikipedia is within you yourself you don't need to go out to other wikipedias and correct what they\n05:25 - have to say and put all your own stuff in all is within you all the knowledge you of the world you need is within yourself all the medicine that you need is within your own medicine box of the\n05:37 - endocrine system of glands and you have iodine and you have all these these other things and you have to awaken the healing within you so the question is what is the\n05:50 - virtue of coming again and again to the same Master to the same place and practice the same technique when you come to the same\n06:07 - place again and again that that place becomes for you a Mand Mand the gate becomes for you the SW\n06:26 - DW and thean becomes the Mand and by your regular practice you become your own is you're sitting in the temple you become\n06:49 - the and then you feel that there is no difference between the Divine and you but if you keep changing your practice and keep changing the vibrations of a and go to different places you cannot\n07:02 - set the first thing is that in order for the spiritual plant within you to grow the spiritual Kundalini to awaken the spiritual plant to grow you must not change your Masters and your Stan not\n07:17 - change the soil H you must not change the soil of the you must not change the soil that is the Stan right and if you go to another place\n07:31 - the main soil the spiritual soil which is given to you in your practice is the Shiva Shakti anusandhan in that spiritual soil your Kundalini energy takes on a certain\n07:50 - momentum a certain pattern and a certain vibration if you practice another technique that momentum pattern and vibration changes I do you\n08:04 - understand I'm not saying go here and don't go there go anywhere but don't change the pattern and momentum then from there if you go to another place still the pattern and momentum changes\n08:14 - of your physical body your emotional body your mental body and your spiritual body which is the movement of Kundalini up and down your spine that is the crema Creme of practicing the same technique\n08:26 - at the same place under the guruk Kupa the same master do you understand so the technique which you practice is like the motor vehicle it has the power it has the\n08:42 - energy but it does not have the fuel of Enlightenment you may have the best car Rolls-Royce Mercedes but no petrol you can't move so you may have the best techniques if you don't have Guru\n08:57 - Kupa then the your car will not move towards the gold do you understand many people have K mudra it is s the technique is perfected\n09:22 - right the gut in the in the top in your in your in your third ventricle that is this is the am if there's no gurur G then you cannot be enlightened\n09:50 - by so it says you may do the perfectly you may do the Kaa perfectly but if the guru Kupa is not Guru pran Guru Kupa in the form of pran is not assisting your schwas pran if Guru chetana pran is not\n10:07 - assisting your shaso pran then your K yog does not become successful therefore guruk Kupa is the Crux of it all it is the CR for success in K yog it is the CH of\n10:25 - the guru which makes your pran shaki anandhan un successful therefore it is necessary for a place the\n10:37 - person and they practice to be the same under the same Guru the guidance of the sguru is always important it is good if you practice your K techniques at home anywhere in\n10:50 - the world but it is even better if you can come once in a month once in 3 months or once in 6 months or once a year to the same master and rejuvenate renew and rejuvenate your\n11:03 - practice so that his Chait the spark of his livingness may enliven your sadna and transform you transform the matter in you to energy to emotions to Devotion to love to\n11:21 - wisdom to Divine Consciousness this is the Alchemy of The Total Transformation which is done by the the soul Chait the light of the soul of the\n11:34 - sadguru is that clear so this is the virtue of coming to the same place practicing the same technique under the guidance of the same sadguru om\n11:51 - namash you also said something uh which says that Guru sanida being in the sanid of the guru is is samadi samadi because when you come in the presence of the master his sh his no\n12:07 - mind State Takes Over You Yes and once you get into that state in which he is the decay of your body cells stop now in this case what happens that the sadguru here you have to imagine him from the\n12:20 - grossest State the sadguru is like a fountain he is he is emitting he's he's fountaining he's fountaining like a fountain Sparks of\n12:39 - light and these Sparks of light create a whole magnetic field in within which you are drowned you are soaked and absorbed like a ragula in the RAS right so you will be like a\n12:54 - ragula in the Russ of the guru rasan but this depends on your mind if your mind is open and absorbs it then so each to the degree of his his Attunement with\n13:06 - the guru each to the degree of his his his Attunement so the guru is always in a state of unman aasta state of samadi if you tune in with him you will also become in a state ofman aast and samadi\n13:19 - some people will emotionally will absorb him at the sguru at the emotional level some people will absorb the sguru at the mental level some people will absorb the Guru sguru at the in intuitional of sap\n13:30 - samadi level some will absorb the Guru at the nalp samadi level which is very rare but which can happen and that's why the guru says Come Share My samadi that's why it is important to repeatedly\n13:42 - come and again to the and again to the same Guru because you can share his samadi and your evolution is quickened by leaps and bounds by thousands of years your evolution is even if you\n13:53 - don't like it even if you in a bad mood come with all your emotional come with all your stress come with all your tension and I will dissolve it even if I'm not here I'm sitting\n14:05 - here I will always be there this is the other important thing this is called Shiva paath in the Shiva paath it is said for you students if any\n14:18 - mind mind is you and Consciousness is me okay let's think that if any mind of the disciple is a tuned to an undifferentiated\n14:33 - consciousness of the master if any mind is attuned to an undifferentiated Consciousness then that mind that mind shall become that Consciousness to the degree of its\n14:49 - Attunement with that Consciousness got it so you you will become me to the extent of your at with\n15:06 - me the Attunement with me your your empathy this actually happens if you try it now also you'll feel the peace you just have to relax it's easier to relax like this\n15:23 - then like this or like this if this is a challenge I'll how the guru can affect me is giving no transmission then of course who's interested in giving you a transmission\n15:35 - you stick your left shoulder out and say it's not some people do that in the west they go and test you and they say\n15:54 - challenge it's not a challenge it is I am a server of humanity and have come to serve you as a servant of humanity accept the service and transform yourself now the second thing\n16:07 - why even after the disciple has rece received all his six crias or 36 crias now as the new age people say the six crias after having been received why you must still come to the\n16:22 - same Stan to the same asham and the same sguru even after you have received your techniques and are practicing them the sadguru still by his spiritual Vibrations by his Kundalini\n16:38 - Shak the energy transmitted from his Kundalini shaki he works on all your sh chakras on every chakra of your being within the chakras are lodged your\n16:51 - DNA he can transform your negative DNA he can transform your negative system he can eliminate your emotions which are suffering the suffering of your emotions is eliminated\n17:06 - by him your stress is relieved that is what is done by sitting repeatedly in the presence of the sadguru any questions yes how do you when there are\n17:25 - a lot of distractions and when you said for also conly stress is you can see when a person is stressed by their behavior you see when a person has more responsibilities usually he stressed\n17:38 - because his mind has been tuned and geared you know his uh what has happened if a fellow suddenly comes from fighting in the like Maharana UD Singh if he's suddenly fighting in this he also\n17:48 - meditates he suddenly comes after a battle and he sits here you'll always see he'll be doing like this not that he's a bad meditator he's good\n18:03 - but his parasympathetic nervous system his alert systems have been geared so much the adrenaline fight flight mechanism is he so charged that it will take him two or three days to calm down\n18:14 - and on the third day he'll be sitting like this timately when I Surrender not when I do it from ego when I Surrender you are the\n18:53 - K so ultimately the good job which is done the ego sometimes has a SAT car and it feels it is doing it but it is the good Lord doing it so when your body language is a little tense and you're\n19:05 - fidgety that means you have a lot of responsibility on you something else is Weighing on your mind you know the mind is so tricky something else is many times it\n19:17 - so happens I'll tell you with me what happens I go into my states of samadi regularly I'm dissolving in my highest samadi but sometimes when I'm in a mood then I have not seen my\n19:30 - grandchildren so then suddenly before I go into that I'm doing my Kaa and after K when before going to Paras I say no I get up I go to the pastry store then I buy\n19:44 - all the cakes for my grandchildren I must finish that that's at the back of my head let me get it done with and then you get the cakes or the pizzas the cheese BST pizzas you know there's a new\n19:56 - pizza which is cheese burst I'm very in Hightech with us because I have grandchildren and they get order all these things and some Italian people who get it ordered like Alexandra orderers\n20:07 - it burst and we are bursting with cheese so then we have this and we have the cakes and all then we are Shanti Shanti then in the then in the evening I can go and meditate and do so when it\n20:21 - happens with me I'm a grast sguru in a grast I have my responsibilities my all my sons and my grandsons know that as far as family life is concerned V is concerned I know nothing I'm a\n20:40 - zero they know it but because of respect they don't say it respect old man has mucked it up he's messed it up there he's gone to this house he was supposed to come here so\n20:51 - many times misunderstanding with the grandchildren and they and there's a huge and the grandchildren are not bothered and I'm not bothered the parents are bother\n21:02 - some protocol mess up or something you see ultimately we have to go in two days not you you're doing K yog you cannot go so easily unless you get D because now you\n21:21 - have hooked god with the practice of your K yog you have hooked the sguru you are coming again and again you are deserving something much more in the fundamental truth of Life which has\n21:33 - nothing to do with the relative truth no man is perfect enough in relativity to judge another man through a zigzag Vision relativity is vision is all zigzag and unless\n21:47 - you're perfect you cannot you you cannot be a judge over another person do you understand the zigzag vision of Relativity does not allow you to be a judge over another person no man until\n22:02 - he is perfect can judge another man God is the only judge his dispensation comes through the law of karma finished he is the perfect judge what he has dispensed to the law\n22:19 - of Retribution the karmic law you are going against the fundamental philosophy the great sages and the Masters the great philosophy of s yog\n22:47 - who says only something can come out of something nothing cannot come out of something cannot come out of nothing but God is God he can make something come out of nothing that's why God is God\n22:60 - that's why he can do the impossible that he doesn't do it to keep his own Law and Order is a different question but don't limit his impossibility don't limit the uniqueness\n23:11 - of the Lord God have full faith nothing is impossible for him and we who are attached to him by a single thread of breath Shiva we will also be saved in his love\n23:26 - and his compassion but for that you must have only one string don't start pulling many strings all of them will break make it stronger\n23:36 - and stronger and stronger and then climb up as the string as the spider's web becomes into a thicker rope you can climb your way right to the top and meet your Divine Lord I I so\n23:53 - that is the virtue of repetition the virtue of repeated coming to the same same sadguru the same sadh and the same Stan sadguru sadh or\n24:23 - Stan yes",

          "title": "Living Master Dead Letter",
          "transcript": "00:19 - I welcome all Divine souls to this auspicious Gathering at the\n00:34 - outset at the very outset let me tell you that I am not a teacher and I don't teach from books I am a Transformer I catch\n00:53 - you shake you and wake you up whatever may be my technique when we were in kindergarten do you know what is kindergarten that's an German word\n01:20 - montis is an English word what do you say in in American what do you call it toddlers Nursery what do you call the kindergarten the school for children from 3 to\n01:31 - 5 kindergarten kind is School for Children and you put some books and toys before them why do they\n01:45 - need a teacher can anybody tell me why does the kindergarten children need a teacher why can't they learn on their\n02:00 - own there apples toys and there are books also why can't they learn the ABC or colors from the book why why can't they they can't read yet they can't read yet right it's good answer so also in\n02:20 - spirituality people who take books from ectic self styled teachers cannot find any learning from that the same reason they can't read the\n02:35 - inner print they can read the letter of the book but not the Living spirit therein for that the master is required and no matter how much you may practice the\n02:46 - spiritual technique right they cannot actualize it into experience so just as a child has reading which comes as a barrier he has to learn to read and someone to tutor\n02:57 - him that this is red this is blue this is sweet give an apple that this is sweet just as you need a teacher for a limited place like the nursery you need a\n03:09 - teacher how much more will you need a master to lead you across the Uncharted territories of the infinite Infinities which lead you to the solitary Singularity the Supreme reality how much\n03:25 - more do you need a teacher or Master this is this is one fact which I put before you and even if you have a car and you don't have the petrol or gas what are you going to do with the car\n03:38 - that's like the book so therefore the living spark comes from the master to the disciple teacher cannot do it one dant volcano cannot ignite another dant\n03:51 - volcano one blind man cannot lead another blind man even if he's a so-called self-style teacher writing books will they will both fall in the ditch because they cannot actualize the\n04:04 - technique into experience can you understand can you dig it nail it nail\n04:16 - it and this is what I'm going to show you through experience if all books were enlightened then the book would read you and you would be the book and book would be you\n04:30 - and the book would be dancing with joy so what I am trying to say before I start teaching you that teaching the sacred Sciences needs the living spark to come from one master to\n04:47 - another it cannot be done by the dead letter it needs a life spark it's very very important the actualization is important the actualization of the dead letter word\n05:08 - into a living experience is the name of the game and the other name for the sadguru or the master is actualization he is the actualizer of\n05:21 - your fantasies into reality that's all [Applause] you cannot you cannot have the inner Guru in America they talk oh I have my inner\n05:40 - Guru and all they don't know what they're talking about because as long as there are ripples of thoughts in your mind's Lake you cannot see the moon of your Delight it'll be shattered into a\n05:49 - thousand fragments I I but if your Lake of mind is blid then only you can see the inner Guru and this comes after the stage of nichar samadi the thoughtless samadi some of you which who I gave you\n06:01 - the experience just now only then the inner Guru arises and you can take guidance till then the outer Guru is a reflection is a manifestation of your inner Guru\n06:13 - when they both combine they go into the dels of the depths of your mind slay the dragon of your ego and both the guru and disciple come up Victorious this is the Mystic spiritual\n06:28 - and symbolic meaning of slaying of the Dragon you cannot slay the dragon alone you need the sguru if you have the\n06:45 - spear you have your physical body but you have not the will and power the will power to throw the spear you cannot slay the dragon the sadguru the master of outward\n06:60 - and inward is your willpower to slay the dragon of your evil I I the dragon is making gurgling sounds taking it Taking its last gasp of\n07:17 - breath Dragon ego is taking its last gasp of breath before it dies and the slaying of the Dragon of the ego is very important which the s uru and the master does and\n07:31 - The Taming of the bull of passions is also important which the master does therefore in kindergarten if you require a teacher how much more will you require it to navigate the infinite\n07:44 - spaces of creation and get to your Divine indwell and get to the Supreme reality this is why a sguru or a master is necessary and Jesus has said Cy not your pearls\n08:08 - before the swine lest they trample those pearls turn around and Rend you a s to give a sacred technique to an unprepared public would lead to the same\n08:22 - results there would be karmic repercussions these karmic repercussions are not understood by the West so they try to show that they secretly go take the mantras promise not to reveal it and\n08:33 - they reveal it in a book this is a gross otherwise they should say before that we going to reveal it give us this technique and but without saying it when they do it it has serious karmic\n08:43 - repercussions for the person who gives it and for the reader because it is for everyone we are giving everyone the spiritual techniques but there's a proper time and proper\n08:54 - season and place to give it to the proper person because the proper people do the proper techniques you cannot put a Michael Phelps in the chair of Step Hawkin and\n09:14 - tell step Hawkin to swim 100 MERS and Michael Phelps to do the quantum physics it'll be disaster this is like this is like this is like a total prostitution of the\n09:27 - inner qualities of a human being which are totally misused for the wrong purposes you have to give the proper technique the proper knowledge to the proper person at the proper\n09:40 - time so the true Master gives the proper knowledge to the proper person at the proper time and in your greed to know it all you read all these books and say I'm\n09:53 - going to do this I'm going to do that but you're not prepared a particular technique is meant at a particular stage after you have ConEd your thoughts then you do a certain Crea after you have\n10:03 - conquered your ideation and thought forms you do the next higher Crea after youve conquered your memory recall of this life you do the higher Kaa that is sound scars so V and sound scars have\n10:16 - the three of six different crias in their stages which the disciple cannot correlate which the master can see and help you along so different techniques are given at different stages if you do\n10:29 - the wrong techniqu at the wrong stage and accidentally put in a technique for 100 volts into a 10 Vol bulb what will happen to the bulb poop temporary\n10:40 - insanity so that's what it's not scaring you it is for everyone it must be given and Baba was said that when the gods and the and the humans there was a conclave that whether this secret sign should be\n10:54 - given to human beings they said no they are treacherous they will not be able to hold their own they have have no self-control of sacredness and Purity but then great yogis like lahari\n11:04 - mahasaya pleaded with the sages of the Ancient of Days and the gods and said no give the humans a chance evolution is too slow they said no they will prostitute the techniques take it print\n11:17 - it at large and throw it to the open public so if you throw these techniques to a juring crowd or if you throw it to some terrorist movement they will burn your Bible and burn your K yog and say\n11:31 - our is the only thing so there are people you cannot throw it to a random public although it is for the whole world but it's to be given in sacredness there is there are three\n11:42 - things to remember three things safety sanctity and spirituality I'm speaking from a life\n11:54 - line of ancient traditional sages and yogis why did the Sages and yogis maintain safety sanctity and spirituality safety they they maintained because a young child shouldn't play\n12:10 - with electronic toys otherwise he will short circuit himself and electrocute himself there will be karmic repercussions for doing the wrong thing at the wrong time there's a season for\n12:22 - everything there's an age for everything you can't expect a three-year-old girl to have a child but when it grows up it's legal and it's necessary and it's commanded by\n12:33 - God that be fruitful and multiply fill this world with beautiful souls and people let them be born there's a proper time so also the safety is\n12:47 - required how the technique should be done second is sanctity the technique should be maintained in its pristine purity pristine Purity means if I form a circle\n13:03 - and I whisper a word if I say kesik off by the time it'll come zingi Bongo last fellow will say Zing if you want to we will try this in\n13:24 - the afternoon we'll sit and Whisper it see what the end word comes so in order to maintain M to maintain sanctity and accuracy of the technique there has to be a certain protocol a stage of giving\n13:38 - it step by step we don't want to hold it from you we want to give it to you at the right time the proper place given by the true Master to the truth's proper disciple at\n13:53 - the proper time if you give it to one who has no faith he will just jur it throw it in give it to the open public what are you trying to prove by this you have to have and maintain the\n14:06 - accuracy of the technique it should not be contaminated by any other techniques should not be mixed up with Tantra should not be mixed up with sex\n14:16 - therefore the sanctity of the technique has to be maintained hence we have a respectful audience a captive audience people who have reverence all of One mind they review he the technique they\n14:30 - value it and these are the gems these are the people and the good Souls whom the technique must be given to it is for the whole world so then they said well we want to give the techniques they said\n14:42 - no human beings will will publish it and give it to people at random that's exactly what's happening which was prophesied then Baba said okay I will give it but give it to those\n14:53 - people I'll I'll ease the technique of K give it to those who meditate 12 hours a day so they said no no Baba you miss I think you're out of\n15:04 - touch mortars don't meditate 10 hours 12 hours in a day they're freaking out and they having this fun and all that stuff they freakers and the the models are control freaks\n15:20 - they're trippy Trippers control freaks it's then we have to evolve the trippy Trippers control so then Baba they said okay you want to further relax it will be\n15:32 - difficult okay do it for 6 hours they said no no no human beings cannot put it's just about 1 Hour 3 hours but once they get going I promise\n15:45 - you that they will reach the heights yes L there are people who have reached the Heights from the Mortal ranks too and therefore he put a code he didn't say distributed freely and publicly he said\n15:60 - give it to the whole of humanity give it to the whole of humanity but let them be screened let there be a certain self-respect certain esteem a certain\n16:14 - procedure whereby it was given so this was the sanctity this was very very important they said that if a person does a higher technique in some of the yoga techniques\n16:27 - you have to have no thought that is Nar samadi if if even one thought contaminates your Consciousness the technique will not be of any Avail and may give you stagnant effects or\n16:42 - even at times negative effects so after you have mastered your thoughts and you're are going to master your ideas or thought forms after you have mastered your vti your thoughts you must Master\n16:54 - PR for that another higher technique is given then after you master thought for and PR you have to master your soundcards for which another higher technique is given one of the highest\n17:05 - techniques of Kaa so this is the status in which the Kaa is related now how will a person who goes to the common public how is he going to find out at which stage he is and what what technique\n17:17 - should be applied to which stage because this these so so-called self style gurus have not mentioned in the book at what state of mind at what evolution of Consciousness so should\n17:31 - that particular K be done it's not given you have nichar Samad you have Anand samadi you as samadi samadi samadi samadi samadi and then you have the K so this has to be\n17:48 - done under guidance if kindergarten requires guidance and the living spark and the love and affection of the teacher so does kria yog require guidance and the\n18:02 - love and spiritual galvanic action of the master to awaken his Kundalini if books had awakened Kundalini they'd be raring up like a cobra and dancing from side to side but\n18:19 - they cannot do that and that's why Masters required the inner Guru does not awaken till the stage of nichar samadi this is what I have to for warn you and tell you and I end with the note that\n18:32 - the sacred science of any yog Tarak Raj yog K yog Gan yog Karma yog B yoke is for the whole world it is your heritage it is your wealth dear Souls come and take it freely but take it from the\n18:47 - proper person the proper Master at the proper place and proper time and therefore it cannot be distributed freely and vulgarly to a random public who has no respect for the\n19:01 - sacred technique the third point is spirituality spirituality is the state and rate of\n19:12 - evolution and you must know can you please sit down you must understand that the living spark comes from the sguru a living Master to his disciple not from a dead\n19:28 - letter of a book for example if your car battery is down it's not this thing you don't take a teacher battery which is also down and\n19:40 - try to jump it you can't jump the car with two batteries who are both down that's like like a self style teacher teaching a blind disciple you try to jump it nothing you need a live battery\n19:53 - a living Master then you put the electronic spark and then the car starts that's the work of the sguru the true teacher and how gurunath will be know\n20:07 - it's a true teacher now you get to the point how will we know and why gurunath the second question is did great masters from Lord\n20:22 - Shiva himself to the great Ries like vashishta and pru and at and vishwamitra and datat and the ADI Shankar aara all the master of Masters and pangali not throw this\n20:38 - these sacred techniques at random to an unprepared public why did they not do it why did they not say that I'll say Abra Kadabra and the whole thing will be enlightened at the same\n20:50 - time they can't of course I can say Abra Abra and give you the same experience at the same time here that is one that's the Lynch pin of the sadguru the true sadguru will be able to breathe through\n21:02 - the breath of all you people at the same time then he goes out of the hall and tells you individually to call the sguru and when you close your eyes and individually call him he replies to you\n21:12 - individually by lengthening your breath he breathes through your breath this is one of the things that you know that he's a sguru he breathes through your breath secondly that is prath then he\n21:23 - gives Shiva paath he transfers his Kundalini energy to you and heals your body mind and spirit Soul not spirit Spirit is perfect and the third he gives you\n21:37 - shapath which is sharing his his clear mind state or his his Universal Soul Consciousness with you where the thoughts in your mind dissolve and become his\n21:49 - Consciousness that is the Tre test of the master that any disciple tuned to the master any mind tuned to an undifferentiated\n22:01 - Consciousness which is the master shall become that Consciousness to the degree of its Attunement with that Consciousness so these These are the litmus tests some of the very few litmus\n22:13 - tests to know that it's a master and therefore you know you're on the right path you are not you cannot even if you have the map which is the book and you don't have the\n22:26 - sadguru who is the beacon of light you you cannot see the map and therefore you cannot go to your destination so the master is like the lighthouse he is like the beacon of Life\n22:39 - on your on your ship which makes you see the stars and the map and your pathway you cannot put off the light\n22:51 - which shows you the direction until you have reached the goal if you have the map in hand but no eyes to see it then the map is useless the master the eyes to see it this is\n23:07 - true he is the beacon of light if you have the car and no petrol to drive it with then you will stay in one place admiring your car you must stay at one place stroking\n23:21 - your book The actualization of the red letter into the live experience comes from the living Master alone that spark of knowingness I hope I have been more than\n23:38 - clear I end this again dear Souls nobody is trying to hide or keep anything away from you nobody it is for everybody but there must be a certain\n23:53 - preparedness for that it must be given by the proper master to the proper disciple at the proper time not randomly thrown otherwise they'll be\n24:12 - chaos [Music] now gur Brahma gur [Music]\n24:33 - m [Music]",

          "title": "The Master Dies To The Disciple (2012) Complete",
          "transcript": "00:31 - The master dies to the disciple to the extent\nof the degree of his concentration on the master. The disciple is sitting and focused on a picture\nof his guru, of the master. Okay? Let's say this is the master here.\n01:03 - Let's say I'm a person called Yogiraj Gurunath. Okay? For all\npractical purposes. This is the master. There's the disciple.\n01:10 - The disciple is focusing on the master. The master is sitting before you, this is\none place. And he is also part of the inner most essence\nof your true self. He's in two places, in your heart and here. So he is subjectively in your heart and objectively\nhere.\n01:39 - Is that clear? Now you begin to concentrate on the master. As you concentrate you will find your thoughts\nare running away. But then you bring it back to his face, his\nhair, his beard. And you are beginning to say, oh, beloved\nMaster I am so happy to have you.\n01:56 - Because when I see your face, I forget all\nmy outward distractions, all my going shopping, even though it's Christmas time, because you\nlook like Santa Claus. So I have nowhere else to go. [Laughter] I mean, I'm just giving you a sample\nprayer. When you say this, you can say [Laughter].\n02:09 - Oh dear Santa, you look so saintly, like Saint\nNicolas, therefore my mind is, whatever the prayer you know, keep praying. Now as you keep praying, the Master creates\na magnetism on his face and in your heart and you get connected to his face. Please keep looking at me, it's going to happen\nwhen I talk.\n02:49 - This is a dynamic process of factual happening\nwhich I am taking you through. It's a dynamic progression. It's an actual happening. Experiential. Then the disciple keeps looking.\n03:16 - And the atoms of the disciple's eyes and the\nmaster's atoms get connected into one form. And the gaze of the disciple steadies on the\nMaster. His mind stops running. So from a state of concentration, the master\nwith his magnetism. The Master, in Indian Language, is called.\n04:05 - He goes by the name of \"spiritual atrraction\". The Master in Indian language is called Guru. The Guru word comes from \"Gurutva\". \"Gurutvakarshan\" which is magnetic attraction. So as the Master does his gravitational effect.\n04:36 - It is gravitation. Gurutva means gravitational attraction. Gurutva means gravity. Gurutva. So the Guru is one who has gravity to bring\nout the hidden knowledge of the disciple and\n04:52 - enlighten him. This is my description. He cracks the code of Maya and takes you to\nBrahma. That is the Guru. He who is the gravity, gravitational well.\n05:09 - So as you keep, the Guru starts dissolving,\nhe starts dying into the concentration of the disciple which now turns into a meditation. And then there's no distraction of thought. The disciple keeps looking at the Master and\nSatguru. The Satguru helps the Master in a uniform,\ndouble way, by creating an attraction in the\n06:01 - heart of the\ndisciple. That is one of the places where he is. The disciple keeps looking with interest at\nthe Guru's face and steadies his mind. The leaking wounds of distracted thoughts\nhave disappeared and the mind is solid and now in a state of meditation.\n06:40 - His thoughts are not\nwaivering anywhere. And the Guru is gradually dying into the disciple\nby his gravity and merging into the disciple. The disciple's atoms are one with the atoms\nof the Guru and he has become an integral part of the disciple's meditation. From concentration the disciple has gone\nto a deeper layer of meditation.\n07:25 - Formerly, in concentration, the Guru was an\nintegral part of him but now he and the Guru are one. The whole of the Guru and the disciple have\nbecome one in meditation. As the disciple keeps looking at the Guru,\nthe Guru further dies into the disciple's awareness and makes the disciple enter from\nthe atomic to the sub-atomic layer.\n08:28 - The Guru loses form. The eyes of the disciple are fixed on the\nGuru and the disciple can see the aura around the Guru. The aura is expanding more and more. It's a white cottony gold with flashes of\nviolet, purple, rose and indigo.\n09:14 - Rose colored, golden colored. And the disciple keeps looking. His eyes are watering not blinking. The Guru's form is disappearing. He goes to the formless state.\n09:33 - That means the disciple and the Master have\nentered from the atomic structure to the sub-atomic structure of the Guru's form. Where they see not his form so clearly but\nthey feel the joy. They see his attributes. So I do not see the Guru's face, his beard\nso clearly but but I 'm now beginning to experience\n10:42 - his sub-atomic energy of ananda, so this is\nfrom the third stage, second stage of meditation he goes deeper into state of ecstacy, first\nstage which is a sub-atomic stage of the Guru's energy of peace. And his mind is fixed upon his Guru. The Guru has died from the form and become\na formless ananda of the heart of the disciple..\n11:52 - This is how the Guru gradually dissolves himself\nand dies to the disciple, killing the ego of the disciple in the process. Next stage. The disciple now experiences only the energy\nof the Guru and he has now entered the sub-atomic stage.\n12:47 - From an integral part, the disciple becomes\nthe whole of the Guru. From a part of his energy of joy of ananda,\nnow the disciple concentrates deeper and goes into an ecstacy of expanded consciousness\nwhere he realises himself as he and the joy of the Guru in all completeness. First he realised the attribute of joy partially,\nnow he goes deeper to realise it completely.\n13:35 - And at this stage, which is the state of savikalpa\nsamadhi, Crack, patack, the ego has split. He has cracked the code. His ego has dissolved. And he is now floating in a vast sea of satchidananda. Then as he goes deeper, the master dissolves\nhimself into the disciple in the final stage.\n14:19 - Where he appears to the disciple and the disciple\nexperiences himself as a vast undifferentiated consciousness of radiant ether. A homogeneous energy of radiant ether. And his mind is expanded to the far limits\nof  the mind and matter of the universe.\n15:06 - He is everywhere. His mind has become crystal thought of existence,\nconsciousness and bliss. He is existence, consciousness and bliss. He has no thought, just the feeling of deep\npeace and subtle waves of joy. He has no desire, nor for himself, nor for\nhis Guru, nor for God.\n15:44 - Knowing that he's experiencing God and floating\nin a vast sea of joy. So the Guru and the Master has died for the\ndisciple to become a sea of joy. He's cracked his ego and disappeared and become\nthe experience of disciple's samadhi. And now he's in a state of self realization. And the disciple's mind is called the bearer\nof truth, because he can see the whole universal\n16:47 - energies working in tandem, working in karma. His mind has expanded to the size of the universe. He has realized God, but only through Divine\nMind. Now in the crucial state. He must take the quantum leap, the paradigm\nshift from Divine Mind to Divine Consciousness.\n17:19 - And nobody can do it for him. If he tries, he fails because in this state\nof mind, the disciple's mind, there is no desire. And to try means, he has a desire. If the disciple doesn't try, he's also stuck\nbecause no effort is made to penetrate the\n18:04 - star of mind. He just has to wait in innocent awareness\nin all humility for the grace of God. In that state, God the Guru will come. When the whole energy of the universe, which\nis like a whole ocean of molten glass. It's a homogenious fabric of radiant ether,\nwithout a ripple of thought.\n18:55 - This will coalesce into a huge star, and the\ndisciple will be pulled through his own star gate by the gravity of Gurukrupa. Gurukrupa. That is the grace of the Guru, where no ego,\nno I, no effort, no practice of Kriya Yoga, nothing will do it.\n19:36 - You just have to be. Then stiller than stillness itself with bated\nbreath I do behold, thy rising self star's nectar gold. And then by Gurutvakarshan, he's pulled through\nthe gate of his own Divine Mind. And he enters from a state of self-realization\nto a state of God Realization.\n20:25 - He enters from a state of Savikalpa Samadhi\nto Nirvikalpa Samadhi. He enters from the spheres of relativity into\nthe state beyond relativity. He has passed the rings past not, by constantly\nbeing in this state, practicing the state of Savikalpa Samadhi. This is the manner in which the Guru dies\nunto the disciple and he leads him from one\n21:02 - stage to a higher, subtler stage of consciousness. And when the disciple has past from a state\nof self realization of Divine Mind, he takes the form of a huge star. And the disciple passes through his own Star\nGate, he falls into eternity. And falls into his own gravity, his own Gurutvakarshan.\n21:32 - Gurutvakarshan, spiritual gravity, goes in\nthrough the star gate. You've all heard of star gate. It's within you. He passes through the star gate. He goes into eternity, or she goes into eternity.\n21:43 - Then they go into a state of Divine Consciousness. But even here as the valiant yogi constantly\npractices, Asamprajnata samadhi or Nirvikalpa Samadhi. Again and again, he's conquered, he's conquered\nhis thoughts. He's conquered his thought forms.\n21:53 - His thoughts are Vritti, he's conquered, Chitta\nVritti nirodha . He's conquered his Chitta Vritti, his thoughts, his worldly thoughts. He's conquered his thought forms, which is\nPratyahara. But he's not conquered, even in a state of\nDivine Mind, he has not permanently conquered what is called his 'remembered experiences\nof past lives\".\n22:12 - Which is Samskars. He's a totally enlightened being. But he's not liberated, he's not got to brahma\nnirvana, he's not got to nirvana moksha. There lies the difference between enlightenment\nand the permanent state of Brahma Nirvana. We use the word enlightenment loosely.\n22:24 - There are many stages of enlightenment. And as he practices, flight from Divine Mind\nof self realization, to Divine Consciousness of God Realization. Again and again he's pulled back to Divine\nMind because desires of past lives, bubble on the surface of his mind's lake, to pull\nthe Hamsa, the Soul Swan back again to relativity.\n22:35 - Then again the valiant yogi tries again for\nNirbeege Samadhi. You see unless the samadhi is less than one\nseed of thought, of all your past, present and future lives, you cannot be liberated. You cannot get nirvana moksha. You can only be enlightened into that state,\nif you got that state you know it, in Divine\n22:40 - Mind. And as he practices, year after year, decade\nafter decade, life after life, the desires of past lives, stored impressions of past\nlives, remembered experiences, bubble up from the surface of his mind's lake to pull the\nsoul swan back into the lake of Divine Mind. And again the valiant soul makes his effort,\nand rises above the lake of Divine Mind to\n22:53 - enter Nirvikalpa Samadhi, Asamprajnata samadhi,\nthe state of Divine Consciousness. And then again, a thousand years ago, he had\nhad a love affair with some name, that love affair comes to thing, that thought pulls\nhim back. Again he must trace it, surpress it and transform\nit and again take the flight. A million times this will happen.\n23:03 - And a million time the valiant soul will fly. He will make his effort or he will just stay\nin the state of passive alertness. So you cannot try and you cannot not try. To get from a state of Savikalpa Samadhi to\nNirvikalpa Samadhi, from Self Realization to God Realization, you cannot try and you\ncannot not try, you just have to be.\n23:19 - You have to be in a state of innocent, passive\nawareness. No bhakti, no shakti, just be. God knows it all. You're already connected. You have to let that boil, boil down.\n23:24 - You have to let the heat subside. You have to let the thought and desire finish. Even the last thought of desire, unless it\nis finished, you cannot get to the permanent. And then after long, long lifetimes, you the\nsoul swan, shall win your wings to freedom. You and your master, your Satguru will be\none.\n23:29 - Such is the work of the Satguru. He takes you from Self Realization to Divine\nRealization. Then as he goes deeper, the master dissolves\nhimself into the disciple in the final stage. Where he appears to the disciple and the disciple\nexperiences himself as a vast undifferentiated consciousness of radiant ether.\n23:52 - A homogeneous energy of radiant ether. And his mind is expanded to the far limits\nof the mind and matter of the universe. He is everywhere. His mind has become crystal thought of existence,\nconsciousness and bliss. He is existence, consciousness and bliss.\n24:15 - He has no thought, just the feeling of deep\npeace and subtle waves of joy. He has no desire, nor for himself, nor for\nhis Guru, nor for God. Knowing that he's experiencing God and floating\nin a vast sea of joy. So the Guru and the Master has died for the\ndisciple to become a sea of joy. He's cracked his ego and disappeared and become\nthe experience of disciple's samadhi.\n24:23 - And now he's in a state of self realization. And the disciple's mind is called the bearer\nof truth, because he can see the whole universal energies working in tandem, working in karma. His mind has expanded to the size of the universe. He has realized God, but only through Divine\nMind.\n24:34 - Now in the crucial state. He must take the quantum leap, the paradigm\nshift from Divine Mind to Divine Consciousness. And nobody can do it for him. If he tries, he fails because in this state\nof mind, the disciple's mind, there is no desire.\n24:54 - And to try means, he has a desire. If the disciple doesn't try, he's also stuck\nbecause no effort is made to penetrate the star of mind. He just has to wait in innocent awareness\nin all humility for the grace of God. In that state, God the Guru will come.\n25:04 - When the whole energy of the universe, which\nis like a whole ocean of molten glass. It's a homogenious fabric of radiant ether,\nwithout a ripple of thought. This will coalesce into a huge star, and the\ndisciple will be pulled through his own star gate by the gravity of Gurukrupa. Gurukrupa.\n25:16 - That is the grace of the Guru, where no ego,\nno I, no effort, no practice of Kriya Yoga, nothing will do it. You just have to be. Then stiller than stillness itself with bated\nbreath I do behold, thy rising self star's nectar gold.\n25:27 - And then by Gurutvakarshan, he's pulled through\nthe gate of his own Divine Mind. And he enters from a state of self-realization\nto a state of God Realization. He enters from a state of Savikalpa Samadhi\nto Nirvikalpa Samadhi. He enters from the spheres of relativity into\nthe state beyond relativity. He has passed the rings past not, by constantly\nbeing in this state, practicing the state\n25:34 - of Savikalpa Samadhi. This is the manner in which the Guru dies\nunto the disciple and he leads him from one stage to a higher, subtler stage of consciousness. And when the disciple has past from a state\nof self realization of Divine Mind, he takes the form of a huge star.\n27:01 - And the disciple passes through his own Star\nGate, he falls into eternity. And falls into his own gravity, his own Gurutvakarshan. Gurutvakarshan, spiritual gravity, goes in\nthrough the star gate. You've all heard of star gate. It's within you.\n27:06 - He passes through the star gate. He goes into eternity, or she goes into eternity. Then they go into a state of Divine Consciousness. But even here as the valiant yogi constantly\npractices, Asamprajnata samadhi or Nirvikalpa Samadhi.\n27:11 - Again and again, he's conquered, he's conquered\nhis thoughts.

Then again the valiant yogi tries again for\nNirbeege Samadhi. You see unless the samadhi is less than one\nseed of thought, of all your past, present and future lives, you cannot be liberated.\n27:31 - You cannot get nirvana moksha. You can only be enlightened into that state,\nif you got that state you know it, in Divine Mind. And as he practices, year after year, decade\nafter decade, life after life, the desires of past lives, stored impressions of past\nlives, remembered experiences, bubble up from\n27:36 - the surface of his mind's lake to pull the\nsoul swan back into the lake of Divine Mind. And again the valiant soul makes his effort,\nand rises above the lake of Divine Mind to enter Nirvikalpa Samadhi, Asamprajnata samadhi,\nthe state of Divine Consciousness. And then again, a thousand years ago, he had\nhad a love affair with some name, that love affair comes to thing, that thought pulls\nhim back.\n27:51 - Again he must trace it, surpress it and transform\nit and again take the flight. A million times this will happen. And a million time the valiant soul will fly. He will make his effort or he will just stay\nin the state of passive alertness. So you cannot try and you cannot not try.\n28:01 - To get from a state of Savikalpa Samadhi to\nNirvikalpa Samadhi, from Self Realization to God Realization, you cannot try and you\ncannot not try, you just have to be. You have to be in a state of innocent, passive\nawareness. No bhakti, no shakti, just be. God knows it all.\n28:18 - You're already connected. You have to let that boil, boil down. You have to let the heat subside. You have to let the thought and desire finish. Even the last thought of desire, unless it\nis finished, you cannot get to the permanent.\n28:38 - And then after long, long lifetimes, you the\nsoul swan, shall win your wings to freedom. You and your master, your Satguru will be\none. Such is the work of the Satguru. He takes you from Self Realization to Divine\nRealization. Once you have Divine Realization, there is\nno Kriya Yoga.\n28:45 - There is no Kriya movement. Kriya is right up to the state of Savikalpa\nSamadhi. And the effort of sitting again, to Nirvikalpa\nSamadhi. But then when you're in a permanent state\nof Nirvikalpa Samadhi, of no thought, no mind. When you're permanently at that state, and\nthere's no desire at all, of person, place\n28:50 - or thing, of present, past or future lives. And your mind is totally crystal. Nay, not totally crystal, when the mind itself\nis totally dissolved. Then the whole universe, you were first, the\nmind in was a state, of an undifferentiated, radiant ether.\n28:55 - Your mind was a fabric of an undifferentiated,\nradiant ether. Now your mind has become a fabric of undifferentiated,\nradiant light. First it was undifferentiated, radiant electron. But remember the electron is one mile slower\nthan light. Then in Nirvikalpa Samadhi, you became the\nundifferentiated, radiant light.\n29:00 - Your body, mind and soul are transformed into\nwhat? Undifferentiated, radiant light. So you are your Guru are one. The Guru has died unto you. He has died unto your ego, to kill your ego\nand liberate you from the trammels of the\n29:05 - senses. Aye? And he has taken you from the, from your mind\nand state, the whole sum and substance of the far limits of the universe. The far energy that reachs the universe of\nmind and matter.\n29:10 - The far limits of mind and matter. From undifferentiated, the fabric of undifferentiated,\nradiant electron, one electron. That electron becomes fluid and flows into\nthe fabric in nirvikalpa samadhi, in God consciousness. Just before you get to God consciousness,\nyou get to a state of an undifferentiated, the fabric of undifferentiated, radiant light.\n29:15 - But even then you are not liberated, although\nyou are in a state of Nirbeeja Samadhi. The Samadhi without...without seed. And then hands between you a faint radiant\nlight. That is the sweet nurse of Nature who you\nknow as Para Prakriti Amba, Mulaprakriti, Para Prakriti Amba, Diva Prakriti.\n29:20 - That is the Divine Universal Mother. And unless she moves out of your way, you\ncannot see Him, about Whom, we know nothing. I don't call Him God or this or that because\nI don't know. And then she showers the blessing. When she moves her curtain of the Ultimate\nMaya which is Ultimate Realization, so high\n29:25 - is this state of Prati-prasav. the state of withdrawl zeroing in. And through the great star, like an infinite\nlotus. You have to pass through the matrix. You have to pass through the Divine Womb.\n29:30 - Which is, Matrix, the word is taken from the\nIndian Sanskrit word called, the word called \"Matrica\". So the correct pronounciation of matrix is\nmatric. Matri. Padma Matrica.\n29:35 - She's called Divine Lotus Mother. So you have to pass through the womb of the\nlotus mother to her Divine Awareness. When she moves, then you go, into the non-being\nessentiality. And so the successful master and the successful\ndisciple have already, enlightened master passed onto the state of the rings past not.\n29:40 - And those who know it tell it not and those\nwho tell it know it not. The master has died unto his disciple. And so many times have they died together\nthat they have become deathless and immortal. This is the paradox of death. That when you die once, you die.\n29:45 - When you die many times, you become deathless. And another name for deathlessness is immortality. And so in immortality, the successful story\nof the SatGuru and the true disciple. So deep is the connection. And I've taken you, along the inner journey\nof the Master Disciple relationship.\n29:50 - Where He cracks the code. He takes you from the Atomic to the Sub-Atomic,\nfrom the Sub-Atomic to the, he gets rid of your protons and electrons. He gets you to the electronic state, then\ngets you to the state of light. Then transcends light and takes you to Divine\nConsciousness.\n29:55 - This is the journey, the inner most inward\njourney of the Master Disciple. I know that you have never heard of the story\nbefore. And you won't hear again. This is inspired from within. And I don't think there is anything else worth\nsaying after this.\n30:00 - And then He takes you to the state of Non-Being\nessentiality. The state of aloneness called Kevaila. The you go to the state where your center\nis everywhere, your center is everywhere, but your circumference is nowhere. You go to the state of the Non-Being essentially.\n30:05 - After which there is no more to know that\nis to be known or not know. Nothing to be said. Nothing to be done. And look at me and be with me. I'll take the burning from the eyes.\n30:10 - No look at me and be still Become one with\nthe Master. [Silence] And after this state, where the\nmind is still, there are no ripples of thoughts in the mind's lake. You are experiencing the soul of your SatGuru,\nYour Master, in profound silence. Your soul and the master's soul is one.\n30:15 - At the deepest level, at the level of Consciousness,\nHumanity is one. (Noise and movement must be cut). To each one will be given, according to his\ncapacity. Drop your mind, open your heart, drop all\ninhibition. Form the Golden Bridge between heart to heart,\nMaster and Disciple and see the Nectar of\n30:20 - Immortality and Self Realization.",

          "transcript": "00:00 - oh the only purpose of man sergeant on this earth is to seek god Hanuman Nagar a person naina swaroopam Nero the roopam yoga Indra medium a virile give a damn\n00:31 - [Music] I bow to the indwelling spirit the divine one residing in all of us let us have a few seconds of silence and introduce ourselves that at the level of\n00:59 - consciousness we are one [Laughter] this is a very sacred congregation and gathering for all of us I am just being in peace with you trying to familiarize\n02:03 - myself with you at the level of consciousness so you have to give me some time okay I'm going to today teach you certain sacred techniques the system and the path of yoga is very\n02:38 - dynamic and very realistic other ideologies and religions due to a shortage of foresight having them the word debt but I ask you one question just as gorakshanath asked his disciples\n03:18 - Naga Arjun who asked tell oppa who was Naropa who asked milarepa tell me what is dead and then come back to me they still haven't answered the question nothing in this world is dead get this\n03:37 - clear nothing in this world is dead the ground you're sitting on is teeming with life teeming with the swirling electrons protons and neutrons everything is\n03:50 - animated but degrees of animation differ therefore when we are in life we are living a life of mistaken identity thinking that we are the body and not\n04:13 - the soul the whole purpose of yoga and the spiritual path in Dharma that is the pathway to enlightenment is to change the gestalt to create the shift from body consciousness to divine\n04:36 - consciousness that you are not a corruptible body but a divine soul you are not a corruptible body but a divine soul you're not this house of flesh and bone which sleeps decays and dies you\n04:56 - are immortal consciousness Lord of the earth and the skies now today I am giving you a very special technique who are these people sitting at the back I don't want anyone here who's not\n05:13 - supposed to be here or people are benefactors here is everybody why is that benefactor being so hot sitting at the back who is that ok are you are you supposed to be here or is they I do not\n05:31 - know if if you're not if you if you have I don't know what it how it is organized but only benefactors are supposed to be here but you can be out or you be here I don't know the organization we'll find\n05:43 - out but I'm carrying a head so are these windows open there's no cross ventilation no draught can we open this windows it is my one and I need a draught\n06:08 - just one one two one or two across so you get a breeze we try to open them last time yeah we requested them last year maybe they will do it they open the door no that'll be\n06:51 - the noise okay settle now so I'm going to give you a technique today it's called the u thing and yanking technique in this technique the aging process of your physical body is\n07:31 - arrested the physical body never dies as you know I mean appealing to your logic nothing dies matter can only be transformed matter is neither created nor destroyed but can only be\n07:47 - transformed it is a law of conservation of mass into energy so you're just going into the other matters going into a different dimension and why I'm making you do this in spite of your Atma your\n07:59 - soul the great for over your Atma how many doesn't know what the Atma is that is the Spirit of God dwelling within you that is the Atma that is immortal it can never die your physical body is also\n08:15 - cannot die it can only be transformed but if you want to assimilate it into a higher principle of the Bodhisattva then you have to do these techniques so it's becoming more and more of spirit and\n08:28 - less and less of matter although nothing is destroyed it is only transformed therefore in the Indian system your whole life your whole life is preparing for death now we don't call it death\n08:46 - your whole life is preparing for the Great Awakening right now when you get to this Great Awakening when you get to the end of your physical body and it is ready for transformation you know into\n09:05 - its own elements there are many activities of thought word and deed and emotions which you have done in your life which need you to pass through certain\n09:21 - which is called purgatory in the Christian thing it is called purgatory in India we call it Davis tan or Dave Archer and which thousands of years later came to the\n09:35 - Buddhists and it was called Bardo for the normal man he has to pass through it but in the Indian text it was always said by the greatest masters that the Indian yogi catches the Bardo by the\n09:49 - forelock and throws it out of the window that's what we are doing no need to give it too much importance because it is astral illusion delusion and error which you pass through you passing through all\n10:01 - the crap that you've created before you get to heaven you pass through certain subtler astral regions which give you either reward or punishment now what I have to explain to you that many people\n10:17 - I meet they say hey let's have wine women and laughter and sermons and soda water the day after let's enjoy life when I come to the point of death I'll focus here like Lord Sri Krishna sets\n10:32 - and then I'll pass out chanting you cannot do that you cannot do that neither can you do that or neither can you do the Book of the Dead because your whole life must be a continuous training\n10:52 - and tuning into the divine consciousness when you go at the last moment all your life's deeds are marshaled before your eyes and you get into a state where you remember those deeds of your childhood\n11:06 - in your past life it's a called state of delirium how many of you seen people going to delirium and remembering their childhood days grannies and great-grandmother's go into that state\n11:17 - you see that they start talking that hey push my swing a little harder harder Martha come on I'm enjoying the swing so this speaking in a delirium those are their past actions so the momentum of\n11:31 - the force of their past sound scars their past actions they are driven to what they do most a crook with always at the dying end think of him breaking us finding the combination of the lock\n11:43 - breaking the safe and stealing a fellow who has drugs will constantly get to him taking the final drug the mescaline like who says I'll discipline Huxley but Huxley must remember that these are\n11:59 - temporary things the sum total of effects is Marshall before your eyes before your pran leaves your physical casement which is transformed dust to dust water to water fire to fire air to\n12:14 - air and soul to soul and the spirit is free spirit to spirit so in our system we do not give much importance to clearing up the crap we put on the light in other systems they say oh you must\n12:33 - atone for their sins there's true confessions I tell them look don't waste time your body your mind your room is dark just go in there and put on the light of Kriya yoga and\n12:48 - the darkness will go this is the Indian yogic system of the yogic philosophy this is the way it is done in yoga we do not tamper with the bar at all or the purgatory or any intermediate state of\n13:04 - the lower astral world because as you all know in the autobiography of a yogi' Sri Yukteswar has described the states of Bardo right why does guru not not give it importance\n13:17 - because he gives you a higher technique do not chase the darkness away put on the light dear Souls put on the light and the darkness is not but you cannot put on the light once and say the\n13:29 - darkness will go you have to do it a million times so when your death comes with spy it's your second nature automatic action the lights go on Death Comes automatic\n13:39 - action the lights go on do you understand what I'm saying so when you're doing this so many times now I can see it without the Jyoti mudra I can I close my eyes and I see the light the\n13:49 - five-pointed star the clear light shiva Netra tarah the clear light is known as Shambhu Chaitanya Shambhu Chaitanya Shambhu ji tanya say after me Shambhu ji Tanya why\n14:03 - are you saying it disorganised Shambhu Chaitanya now say it with me Shambo Jaison Shambo Jaison Shambo Jaison Shambo Jaison Shambo Jaison Shambo Jaison Shambo\n14:18 - Jaison Shambo J&D come on with your thumbs finished benzine is over petrel finished energy is finished okay listen listen you guys are not collected and organized for my techniques I often ask\n14:45 - Barbra Jean Lord Shiva why I've been sent here what is my work I am I'm a damn misfit here I am a misfit but I'm trying to fit into you please try to understand the import of what I'm giving\n14:57 - you I'm giving you processes which clear your body mind and soul so that at depth you do not have to pass through purgatory and Bardo you will go straight to the clear light why because you've\n15:12 - been practicing at hundreds of times again and again and again and again you have become addicted to God you have become addicted to God wants you to addictive you to God you can't say oh I\n15:25 - just learnt the bardo and at the end I practice this role you are not going to practice that and all you're going to be there's going to be a kick-ass system and you're going to be kicked really\n15:34 - hard there's no cheating you can't cheat and fudge or you can't see how I'll just go and Lord Krishna set up sitting Lotus posture and I'll say I'll put my area do you think it's easy to do that if you\n15:51 - think so I burst your bubble tonight you have to be repeatedly in that zone you have to practice practice practice day and night you can say oh I'll come I've taken the advanced techniques I've been\n16:09 - to you know Joseph you Steen's evangelist lectures and I'd be liberated he told me I've been to color in pushes technique I've been to the Dalai Lama I've been to the Tibetan system I've\n16:26 - been to Gurunath and I've learnt all the creative you may have been to all the people in all the world I don't care are you trained is it your second nature as soon as you close your eyes you see the\n16:38 - light and you've gone through it then and then alone you'll go straight to the clear light the eternal flame the Chaitanya the clear light so you have to cut through the agency of delusion\n16:54 - illusion and error Boom Boom Boom's for home my home Janome the palms at seven places where does the Bardo come on boom bah bah ohms so only the second and third stage there are seven states to go\n17:13 - I'm telling you to hit form Satyam these are the techniques of Kriya yoga which get you the highest fear and in the process rub out the negative astral stuff all the BS in your mind all the\n17:26 - negativity in your mind by making you practice day in and day out and clearing that process so you get a clear exit to God this is important and the person\n17:45 - standing at the door with the gates is none of them much Sandra not called lahiri mahasaya and three of Tishri he is also called Avalokitesvara loki - will you be sure\n17:57 - Padma Sambhav one and the same person they hold the keys not to paradise but to the highest heavens so this is very important to understand in one moment you cannot train suppose you just say I\n18:14 - tell you the technique okay now when you go to the Olympics just chant oh lord give me power give me strength and give me the final burst so I win the hundred meters give me power you say ten times\n18:28 - and then you go and you put it up against a hundred meters the blue-ribbon event the hot red ribbon event 100 meters - how many you know is know of the Olympics how many - have not heard\n18:41 - of the Olympics how many have not heard of the 100 meters sprint how many if not out of San Bullet your Hasan vault is the world champion now you go with a mantra okay and you practicing yoga\n18:57 - getting up against a guy who life after life has been running with the Panthers the deers and the wild beasts and has got his muscles trained like a cougar and a panther in his life and you're\n19:10 - saying okay I'm speedy I'm strong I'm going to win this race I'm speedy I'm strong and then you enter the race the results will be disastrous before you've started he will have ended so same as we\n19:26 - death you cannot slide into a moksha you cannot get to the final state unless you practice practice practice their souls persevere in this the magic success perseverance is the magic of\n19:39 - success no matter how many books you read in the world how many philosophies you study how many organizations of yoga and meditation you do if you don't practice the one\n19:53 - solitary technique why do you want to go to the lower techniques of getting through the astral realm of getting through you know David chan or barred at all or\n20:02 - purgatory leave your purgatory behind man leave your purgatory behind take your opening doses well before clear your stomach clear all the BS get ready by\n20:16 - the time you're dead you should be a glowing light you use your body should become the clear light every time I come to you in the night and the Dreamweaver I'm doing the Bardo with you every time\n20:34 - and with all modesty I say all humility here in the known world nobody else is doing it I have to make it clear to knock off the BS in your mind that you're coming here you're very special\n20:46 - people that where you come here and I will do the Dreamweaver to the shortcoming will not be from my side when I put fear to you in the dream in the Bardo and I clear your negativity\n20:57 - and the BS I always tell you don't I that I'm the garbage man and you're the can so open the can let the garbage man do his work and clean you but it is repeatedly done and that master touches\n21:13 - you in your astral and causal body then the process of cleansing starts purgatory is just a process of cleansing the David Chan the Bardo is a process of cleansing we don't need to do it we've\n21:26 - long passed it so you come into your Bardo and we'll clean it all at once so only when you repeatedly practice on the track and field events Michael Phelps anyone heard of Michael Phelps\n21:44 - do you know the sort of practice he does I've I saw video in which he practiced they lay their life on the line man you can't just go and say at the last moment now I am a water torpedo I'm going to\n21:60 - beat him I'm going to go at the speed of light and it won't do it won't do till for a hundred lives you practice in the pole and it swimming then you will be born a human fish a barracuda then\n22:14 - you'll get the speed so what we are trying to do here with you do you understand that this is not merely a fun game of something I'm I'm here trance transforming your lives to cross the\n22:28 - bridge of some Tsar to cross the bridge of the not only the physical but the astral get to straight to the clear light of the chaitanya the inner star shiva Nitra tara the star of the eye of\n22:45 - shiva the jewel in the soul and therefore you need practice these techniques they are all moving towards life so after your life you will not die you will get to the great awakening I\n23:02 - need to tell you something and I will confess before you many people many people have faith in me and they have come and told me guru not we have been to many teachers but I have come to you\n23:28 - I did not have faith there that they would be by my bedside when I died they used the word death I said I'll be there when you awaken not die and they told me that because I have faith I'm\n23:46 - with you because there's something in you that I feel that you can do it even when you're not in this body and the day before yesterday I won't name's I was put to a test not once or\n23:60 - twice and both the times the person before dying I'm telling you this to have solace that I promise you that you will not those who practice sincerely the Kriya yoga and yoga mudra will not\n24:11 - die in darkness they will be assured by the light to the great tunnel of joy to such a down on the existence consciousness and bliss and even if you go to the Bardo you will be saved and\n24:23 - protected by the Guru every path every footstep of the path this is a fact and so so when he went he said you want this photo Jesus or Krishna this thing he said no just get me good or not and he\n24:44 - got my photo and while he was passing away he closed his eyes and he said I can see him even with closed eyes I have no pain in the cancer no pain in my paw straight my throat my lungs I'm in bliss\n24:58 - I am going it is not my effort because I have not made enough it is his effort and I am gone so when I got this news I myself had not confidence that I would keep my word it is a great\n25:15 - responsibility to be by the bedside of a person when he gets through his greatest moment of joy is when you when what you call is death because that is not your death that is the wakening into the\n25:29 - divine light in our philosophy we have no death as Lord Krishna said dynam tundishes Ronnie Navin day at the pavakah the Clarion T upon associate America you are the divine soul o Arjun\n25:44 - your body but a comment is in karmic women thrilled you are the divine soul focused not on the body but focused on the soul for you are the divine soul the water cannot wet you the breeze cannot\n25:56 - dry you the weapons cannot pierce you the fire cannot burn you you are the immortal Atma and therefore live without fear fight the good battle for if you win you shall\n26:07 - rule as supreme King and if you die you shall attain final moksha so this is Arjun was known as the great the Mahad upon the great tapestry it's constant in deep meditation for years so this is my\n26:23 - message to you don't get caught up in emotions don't get caught up in the Bardo there's no need this is for the Yogi's I'm speaking to the Yogi's now you'll ask me how about the ordinary\n26:36 - people yes for the ordinary people in India we have three processes when a person dies so after he is dead to guide him like in Tibet they have one process which was taken from Indian books which\n26:55 - nagarajan wrote was taken to Tibet and preserved then is called the Tibetan Book of the Dead which is not a Tibetan Book of the Dead it is the Indian Book of the Dead\n27:04 - or if you want to be Lahontan but I'm saying it's the human book it is to guide people by constant vibration after they have left their physical body to go back to its elements they have one book\n27:19 - which has come from the land of India land of Liberation's the top of booming so there are three processes when a person dies the normal death he has to go through purgatory he's not like us a\n27:39 - yogi practicing and neither has guru not given them the word that even if you don't practice I will be by our bedside no so they have a book called the Garuda Purana the Garuda Purana the Parana is a\n27:53 - ancient history and genealogy of all your ancestors all your families and spiritual practices which are done so you not only pay the debt of your karmic leisure\n28:05 - of yourself but also of your ancestors it is called the Garuda Purana so this is for normal people it is read for 10 days the same practices in Tibet after three days the soul disengages itself\n28:27 - from the ethereal and physical body the same is given in the the Persian doctrine of the Zen Dawa stuff the FARC's 72 hours India says 72 hours Tibetan Nuuk 72 hours after that the\n28:44 - reading of the Garuda Purana carries on for 10 days during this process the soul is guided step-by-step into the places it goes and it is told what it is an old language many of it is metaphorical it\n29:02 - has to be taken in a practical sense and interpreted it's codified the Garuda Purana it has to be taken in a practical sense that every action has an equal and opposite reaction whatever he did\n29:14 - karmically he has to repay in those those astral spheres boom Havas raha then there is another Book of the Dead for people who have died a premature death an accident in accident and in\n29:38 - unforeseen circumstances there we have a pole so it is known as a pre-shot chick death then for him did the person to listen after 72 hours they'd have a pole on at which they have an arson like this\n29:53 - and they tie the red arson it's red in color the dead soul comes there distance that is called the barber they read the bandwidth the resonant frequency and the vibrations of the bhagwat release that\n30:08 - soul from its astral shell let's it go to the causal shell the shells have to be broken as they are guided to the paths and tunnels and various alleyways\n30:21 - they're not only tunnels the oceans to swim the mountains to climb their tunnels to go through the tunnel of light comes later the tunnel of clear light even the cosmos has to go through\n30:34 - the Great wormhole even our galaxy is subject to this the book of the Great Awakenings so the first book of the Great Awakening issue which is a misnomer called death is called\n30:45 - the Quran the second book of the Great Awakening guiding you through these difficulties is the bottom and the third for liberated soul either you can read the ship piranha the Bhagavad Gita so\n30:57 - these these books are guiding factors to the soul that is departed from the body but it's still lingering lingering in its in its astral form it lingers and to break that lingering spook that that\n31:11 - astral being which sometimes you see apparitions and ghosts that is the soul which is marking time that is liberation happens suppose a soul is to live 80 years it dies at the premature death at\n31:28 - the age of fifty years it marks type taut it marks time in limbo for thirty years I am giving you this knowledge because it was needed you needed to have a certain background so\n31:43 - according to the great Chinese philosopher Leo Tong he says that India is the source and a mother of all spiritual language a trickle of it went out and inundated the whole whole of\n31:54 - Southeast Asia and later its fragrance and influence spread to the Western world the deepest known and codified language in the minds of the people very bad Indians at writing and codifying\n32:09 - today even you go you will meet people who will chant ten Bibles all by heart in one shot they have it printed in the indelible substance of the mind this is very important to know and you\n32:29 - must be rested at this that we are taking you this is the main factor to scoop you out of that that space this is only for you not the common lot the people who practice Kriya yoga shall not\n32:41 - die in darkness provided it's a sincere persevering practice don't take this as empty talk or parlor talk and it is not come walk into my parlor said the spider to the center spider to the fly it's not\n32:59 - a trap either I'm not a spider and you're not the fly but you I will liberate from the web of the spider of delusion illusion and error you are in the web you think you are a physical\n33:13 - body and have a soul the greatest gift of India is its patterns of breathing where teaches you to disengage from the trammels of the senses and free your soul to unite with the infinite spirit\n33:25 - of God this is the sum and substance of the teachings this is the purpose the only purpose of you of your journey on this earth is to seek God don't seek part part at all don't seek\n33:42 - purgatory don't seek anything less the yogi as you are strong catch it by the forelock and throw it out of the window I'm very strong against this teaching because I have been one of the main\n33:55 - proponents of Tibetan yoga and Buddhism and I was born in India long time back ago and I went to Bhutan and Tibet and set up all this system do you know that we were they had no language of their\n34:12 - own do you know where the language came from for Tibet it came from India the great scholars and Yogi's of India chalked out a language which is spoken by them called the Tibetan language now\n34:27 - the son is telling the father come I will teach you some you so now save Michael doors open or Matt Hodges or you also tell me come on girl not with teacher\n34:47 - Dillons has got some new yoke they'll go to him and beat things I won't be very interested you know he'll be teaching my own stuff old wine in new bottles old wine in new bottles so please don't get\n35:02 - mixed up with us many of you going I would not go into the sphere of the emotional body it's very bad it gets it wastes a lot of time be clear have compassion but don't get involved in\n35:15 - emotion the astral body is to be cleansed thoroughly and this is done by the constant breathing of Kriya yoga Kriya Yoga is the factor you",

          "transcript": "00:00 - offering your ego to the sguru or to the Divine in whom you have faith and devotion that is B yog then we come to the other yoke\n00:15 - called gan yog gan yog is the yog where you use the intellect and the intuition to get to the subtler aspects of your beings to know your still mind and\n00:29 - outwardly to know the workings of Nature and how nature can be harnessed to help you to evolve Accord to your inner\n00:42 - God and the fourth yog is called Raj yoke which is the technological yog and Lord SRI Krishna recommends this very highly it is called the lightning path the Raj yog is called the lightning\n00:60 - path this is the technological yog in which you use specific States techniques and specific degrees\n01:11 - of concentration to refine your mind to become the Divine mind and then this Divine mind is later transformed into a more finer essence\n01:30 - and then transform to Consciousness so the whole rajic process I call it the Alchemy of Total [Music] Transformation you got\n01:51 - it so now in the system of Raj yog it's a step by step system of yum which means restraints and disciplines to be\n02:13 - obeyed then Ms which are the performance of certain duties regularly in order to attune your mind to a higher\n02:28 - Consciousness Young then there is the third discipline in yog which is called which are like physical exercises arobic exercises they're\n02:41 - called Arenas postural integration which tune your body and make your mind [Music]\n02:55 - flexible to further the more advanced practices of yog so we have [Music] y then we have\n03:08 - PR pranayam is the utilization of the life force energy in your body the life force energy pran is a bridge between humanity and Divinity it connects\n03:22 - you and they often Sayad or is a wealth which Humanity must use by which he can remain healthy he can detox his system he can evolve his\n03:41 - Consciousness and prolong his life a scientific process of pranam helps you to Pro prolong your life after pranam comes when you create do the pranayam in your spine you\n04:02 - magnetize your spine and that magnetization of the spine automatically pulls your five sense telephones inward the spine pulls your s sense of sight taste touch smell and hearing all these\n04:18 - five senses which go to the outer world you get distracted by seeing something then you get distracted by hearing something so to to to in order to facil itate a superior\n04:35 - concentration which is the nature of man the distracting sense telephones which are outward going must be turned inwards the connection to the outward must be touch\n04:48 - disconnected so this is called prahar and how does this happen by magnetizing your spine by doing your Kaa yog all of you have done Kaa yog and I think you know what it is\n05:04 - shanan yog is also a part of advanced Kaa yog so when you do the Kaa practice you magnetize your\n05:19 - spine after pranayam the magnetized spines makes your sight taste touch and five senses inward looking they turn inwards this is called the withdrawal of the senses from their\n05:36 - objects it's a way of life but it's very scientific also now after your senses have been withdrawed and are looking inwards towards the Crea breath you're not\n05:48 - distracted by outward sceneries or outward sounds then you can do concentration concentration what is concentration\n06:08 - concentration is the faculty of exclusive attention one pointed attention but it cannot be achieved immediately when you try to bind your\n06:23 - mind to particular object see an image of Lord Shiva you bind your mind and that is concentration but suddenly there's some the cook comes there with some uh Cups of Tea and Kettles and\n06:37 - saucers and what not so the Mind from the image of sh gets diverted then the Mind somebody is playing outside then some deer come out under the trees again your mind gets distracted so when you\n06:51 - bring your distracted mind when you pull it back to the subject of your concentration the mind is like a distraught child is running outward hi and darting here and there to\n07:05 - repeatedly bring the Mind back again and again to the object of your concentration is called the process of concentration this is how we are dealing with the quality of\n07:19 - mind the mind is not easy to deal with because it has tens of thousands and thousands and millions of thoughts which have to be disciplined and\n07:33 - regulated like you discipline your physical body by Arenas so you have to discipline your degrees of your mental Body by concentration and\n07:47 - [Music] pranayam so when you repeatedly bring your mind to the object of your attention then there comes a time when your mind is\n08:01 - steady and is able to focus on the object that you are looking to be attentive to you are paying\n08:14 - attention without attraction but the moment you can pay attention without any distraction the process of concentration takes a deeper form of concentration called\n08:28 - meditation so from dhana which is concentration you go to meditation which is so is a flow of your mind on the material\n08:49 - objects the material objects made of molecules and atoms now as you keep concentrating on the image of Shiva or say you're concentrating on the\n09:06 - on the image of gurunath he is here so you can concentrate on his physical object be careful because as I'm describing to you I may play the role of what I'm\n09:19 - describing I may literally start becoming subtle and disappearing so this will happen because if you focus so now you're totally focused on me your mind is not distracted\n09:31 - as you focus on me the degree of your concentration is going to define the degree of refinement of your mind and as your mind gets more and more refinement as more and more refined you\n09:45 - get closer and closer to the truth called God this is the name of the game by concentration refining the quality of\n09:56 - your mind now the concentration the beauty is the concentration the substance of your mind which is being reformed and the object\n10:08 - which you are which which you are trying to focus on are basically made of the same material but some grosser and some thinner so you have to get through the\n10:23 - grosser material of molecules and atoms so as you keep looking on the guru you keep focusing focusing suddenly a strange thing in meditation or Dan you are in Dan in meditation\n10:36 - now and as you keep looking at your master a very subtle thing happens your mind is focusing only on your master and his voice nothing else and suddenly the degree of your\n10:54 - concentration slips into a finer level but that slipping of the final level corresponds to your guru's Atomic body as your concentration you focus on your Guru his\n11:10 - Atomic self becomes finer and you slip to a subatomic your mind slips to a subatomic State you are not only seeing his atoms but you are seeing his electrons protons\n11:25 - and neutrons you know like you see on a television when it goes off you see dot dot dot dot dot you see the spatial difference the spatial difference between Dot and Dot so as\n11:38 - your concentration refines the degree of refinement of the concentration determ determines the degree of refinement of your mind this is a great secret which the yogis have brought to the world in\n11:51 - the high highest py science of spiritual psychology the psychology of Spiritual Awakening and as you keep looking at the master you get into a state of\n12:06 - samadi this is a very simple samadi but you're not looking at his physical object neither is your mind simultaneously become uh composed of atoms your mind has become\n12:21 - subtle like subatomic particles of electron protons and neutrons and so is the Master's body of molecule dissolve to the subatomic level of electron proton and neutrons as you\n12:36 - enter the state of nichar samadi Nar samadhi means where there are no thoughts you are just hearing the sound of the guru understanding it without any mental\n12:52 - effort the thought free stage of samadhi and your mind is corresponding to the subtle of the body of the guru who is transformed into a very very subatomic process he only thinks hearing his voice\n13:08 - and seeing his face and that's all and the face is tending to become more and more fluidic like an ocean it's it's tending to become more of vibration and less of\n13:23 - matter and like a negative and soon your mind along with the guru is composed into a vast Lake of internal peace and joy this is the next stage called Anand samadi now you have gone into the state\n13:41 - of Anand samadhi this is a beautiful meditation and walking you through the subtler and subtler states of your mind the form of the guru outside is nothing but a projection of the subtler states\n13:54 - of your mind as your concentration deepens you will be able to see first my MO body then my Atomic body then my subatomic body then my electrotonic body then the electron body and then you'll\n14:08 - see my body of light so as you go deeper and deeper in concentration not shifting your eyes from me you will certainly go into deeper and deeper states of\n14:19 - concentration depends of how much you focus on me I'm helping you with my awareness to concentrate on this physical body which is not me I am the awareness the physical body is now out\n14:29 - of form however from your subtle samadi of Nar the thought free state of Samad you get to a state where which is an samadi in this you are floating in a vast ocean of\n14:44 - bliss the Bliss is very subtle it first appears to you as a profound peace in your eyes heart and head and there is only the feeling of I am\n14:60 - and I am enjoying this I am because me and my Guru are one I am one the world doesn't matter I'm looking at my Guru with sparkling eyes I become one with the guru's form and I'm floating in a\n15:12 - vast Bliss of Joy but I still have the eye which is the [Music] ego and as you see the body temporally the body of the guru disappears and then\n15:26 - appears like a negative or a film but the is to keep your eyes open not look here and there like people are fidgeting at the back you should not move it's a very high degree of\n15:37 - concentration you people are clearly not ready for what I'm giving you I'm teaching you PhD and you're just the second grade don't move keep looking at me why are you not looking at\n15:50 - me if that gentleman cannot sit go back and sit in a chair if you cannot sit on the floor you're not to move you to look at me only and as you're floating in the vast\n16:04 - sea of joy you are in a subtler state of mechanism which is called a tool to get into God it's it's a technique called Anand samadi and your\n16:16 - mind from electron protons and neutrons the neutron has disappeared into the proton and your mind is only electrotonic now I as you seeing the molecule disappears into the atom as\n16:32 - your mind becomes subtler the atom disappears into the electron proton and neutron as your mind goes into from nichar samadi your Neutron disappears into the proton and you are electr\n16:44 - protonic mind the proton is the eye it is the atom it is the desire in every human being that is the ego and you are looking and there is only one there's no\n16:56 - un and I there's only one eye and then as you keep looking deeper and deeper the sadguru guides you he refines your mind by his talk as you concentrate degree by degree your mind gets more and\n17:11 - more refined from the electr proton neuronic neutronic to the electrotonic mind and then suddenly from Anand samadi you slip into a certain state of as MIT samadi where your eye the\n17:33 - proton disappears The Eye disappears and you are your mind is composed only of the electron the guru is only the electron of Luminosity he is only light this experiment I'm giving you in\n17:48 - the way of life of yoga will depend upon the degree of your relaxed concentration on the image of the master to that degree you will get the result I am there for you be totally\n18:00 - relaxed focus on me and now only I'm not made of neutrons they have been absorbed into the proton the proton has being absorbed into the electron and that's how your mind becomes more and more\n18:11 - refined from an atomic mind it's just become an electron the quality of the electron is Luminosity and here as you look at me you become more and more silent very\n18:24 - very silent I'm not only giving you a lecture I'm giving you a practical demonstration this is an experiential satsang which only a sguru\n18:35 - can give you any true sguru if he is not a sguru then most probably he is not qualified to give it to you and as you look at this electronic remember the electron is just\n18:49 - one mile slower than the speed of light and as you see the form of your Guru as the light the sad Guru he's coming into your third eye as a DOT then he's expanding as a form form and figure\n18:60 - and then he's floating like an ocean he becomes like a lake and disappears The Black becomes White and the white becomes black like a negative and at moments the S guru's form\n19:11 - disappears and then as you see him some see the passage the tunnel of electrons leading you in a Vortex your mind becomes refined and becomes a Vortex leading you from the electron the\n19:27 - particle it leads you to the big wave of light and you have become light the room has become light the guru has become light and your mind has become very subtle from the subatomic particles to\n19:41 - the electron to light itself this is the process of yoga this is the process of the Aly of Total Transformation which yogis take Life After Life which I'm compressing to you in a nutshell within\n19:54 - 1 hour 45 minutes that's all and here your Flo in a sea you have gone into the state of Nala samadi so your mind has become more and more\n20:07 - refined from the molecular to the atomic subatomic electronic and now your mind has become light so yoga is the science of all Sciences because it deals with the science of man if man were not there\n20:23 - not given much importance all Sciences would go to hell because there would be nobody to organize them nobody to command them nobody to receive them nobody to teach and nobody to learn if\n20:34 - it hadn't been for the science of yoga the alemy of Total Transformation and here as the light I floating the room is filled and flooded with light now from light we have to go to a higher stage of\n20:45 - light as you keep concentrating the concentration has become a vast awareness where you are totally absorbed in the sound and the face of your master which is keeping appearing and\n20:55 - disappearing into light when it become when you see him as a form he's is a particle electron and when he you see him as light he's the Wave light he is a wave of light and a particle electron is\n21:06 - the wave particle duality it still hasn't been discovered by science science has not discovered it science has not been able to tell the difference whether this creation is matter a\n21:19 - particle or whether the creation is a wave whether creation is light or whether it is matter they have not been able to decipher the yogi by personal practical experience not only has\n21:30 - discovered this truth that it is beyond light the whole of creation not only does the sguru do that but he makes every single person who comes to his satsang whether he's prepared or ready\n21:44 - or not and gives them a partial degree of his experience of Truth to the degree of the receptivity to his experiential transmission and as you see the light the light tends to become\n22:00 - colorless and as your thoughts die away the light are thoughts thoughts are light and as he speaks your thoughts become no thought and just a wave of lightless\n22:12 - light and there is a vast Stillness as you keep looking at him the guru disappears you disappears you have no eye and you are in a stage of D make samadi that is the n\n22:27 -

Creme of yoga and who says that the Indian people as heathens and they backward people they are just chanting and they know nothing they are the most scientific people in the world because\n28:57 - you've gone H Club looking at the trees and monkeys and you know researching on the rees's monkey somebody's researching on the blue whale somebody and the types of cats there\n29:10 - are the Indian person says come on your Pap from the best research on yourself for there is God within you research upon yourself this is very\n29:24 - very important to know and today you have known now I will take questions there is a question from YouTube what is the significance of Po\n29:39 - in the practice what is the significance of Po in the K practice okay it's from Jonathan in London from Jonathan Jonathan in okay so that means he's a k Yogi because\n29:57 - he knows the toer is he a k Yogi we don't know okay so now the toar is a form this is I was talking to you about the vastest the\n30:13 - most advanced yog which is called the Raj yog and the samadi yog I took you to the highest States this is about a fundamental and yog which I teach without which the\n30:27 - higher yoke cannot happened this yog is very crucial to us it is called Kaa yog in Kaa yog there's a practice called toar Kaa now we have Meridian points in our\n30:44 - spine three Meridian points are very knotted there what are these Meridian points they are composed of ultra sound and vibration they are they it is PR vibrating at a very high\n31:02 - intensity so when PR is vibrating at a very high intensity it forms a knot called a grany and toker crias are mentally striking these knots these Gris to loosen the pic\n31:17 - thread of Brahma grti Vish grti and rudra grti these three there are unique techniques called toker crias to reduce and loosen these Gres so that the upward flowing consciousness of Chait May the\n31:35 - jmic Consciousness May flow to S and merge into the parat Consciousness that technique which I meditated with you just now was an advanced\n31:48 - technique of a type of CER yes [Music] just if you can manage some tea or something can you\n32:13 - huh after the retreat okay okay next question hello yes so now there's a question on YouTube was Jesus a yogi\n32:35 - what was Jesus a yogi was Jesus a yogi yes you see according to my there's a specific definition and a general definition in a general\n32:53 - discipl in a general definition anyone who lives a disciplined and healthy life is leading a yogic life according to the Cadian rhythms of nature but in Jesus's case Not only was a natural Yogi but he\n33:09 - was specifically a yogi also Jesus uh and it is mentioned in certain books like autobiography of the yogi and other places where Jesus knew and\n33:22 - practiced a certain form of pronic discipline and meditation they say he prayed but this discipline was never given out publicly as a teaching I think only the younger the inner group of uh\n33:38 - the the the Hebrews and uh the Jews who were there with him they knew about this breathing technique because that time there were no microphones no televisions uh no\n33:51 - media to spread so if Jesus had a crowd of say 50 people it would be a very very big thing there was one means of communication however\n34:03 - through the through the men and the ladies of the place if the news spread then by Coconut Telegraph by chat chat chat chat m to the news used to spread and hundreds of people used to come for\n34:15 - the talk so there was a there was a way of spreading this information and he was a yogi because they say that on the last day he brought up his\n34:29 - pran he brought up his PR to his head SRA and when they took him down from The Cross by yogic Method he brought down the pran resusc resurrected his body on the third day because he said in the\n34:45 - Bible he said you destroy this Temple and I will I will raise it and build it up in 3 days but the temple he meant his body so when he was laid in the Tomb 3 days later he arose\n34:58 - the same thing was done by the great Yogi lah mahasaya he not only did he arise but Jesus was from the cross laid in the Tomb with the body was intact L masa's Body was\n35:12 - burnt and he reconstructed from the burnt body and appeared to seven people yoga that is the greatest Resurrection I have seen in the case of ganar he\n35:26 - resurrected after being buried resurrected and appeared to three to five people at the same time and said don't worry I am alive and he appeared to Perman Yogananda in Bombay in the\n35:39 - Regent Hotel and he he gripped Yar and he said when I gripped it the body was very ethereal and spiritual and light and I could feel the\n35:49 - tingling in my inner arms even after he had left me he said I must go now and yogan said I will not leave you I will not leave you so say no but it's time now I have to it's enough I've given you\n36:03 - D and yogan didn't leave him so he just melted and dissolved from between his arms and disappeared what did I teach you about disolution your mind I took your grosser\n36:19 - mind right I took a Ras mind and from a molecular mind I made it Atomic then subatomic electrotonic electronic and mind of light right that\n36:50 - is the same process withar but in a much faster sequence he he employs the same process of disintegrating and integrating a body and disag integrating the body by the the the irus the ego the\n37:08 - mind the senses the mahat Tas the tan Matas Tas the senses that's how the body is made the Naya the body is created and it is disintegrated is this clearly\n37:26 - explained yes next [Applause] question I have two practical questions uh one of the practice\n38:13 - manifestation uh I'm I would like to know your uh view on this please my view on this that there is a process\n38:28 - of manifestation and absorption so when you manifest you are outward going your senses are outward going you manifest they says by some\n38:40 - lucky chance you are a very wealthy person you can manifest money you can manifest Fame and name these are material things they take you in the outer world and they get\n38:52 - you caught and trapped in the wheel of life and death This is my May what I'm teaching is to lessen your manifestation lessen your physical demands take all that energy\n39:06 - and focus it on God because what is it by manifesting which you can manifest all my answer\n39:20 - is God is that by manifesting or realizing which you can manifest and realize all this is the answer to those foolish people who try to you know manifest a\n39:43 - golden ring a little jewelry and try to do some Tantra and somebody donates them a car or they create these are stupid things you are going for pieces of\n40:01 - glass the real gold and diamond is the Lord God who is immort unshakable unchangeable Everlasting Eternal from eternity to\n40:17 - Eternity is the Lord of our Divinity our breath and life and love and livingness and everything that we are and we are not is the Lord God so you foolish people turn your minds Inward and seek\n40:32 - that which by seeking which you will find all what is that by knowing which I may know all God is that by knowing which you may know\n40:49 - all what is that by having which I may know I may have all God is that by having which you may have all what is that by manifesting\n41:08 - which I may manifest God is that by manifesting which you may manifest all oh you foolish outgoing people of the world can you not see is there any bigger\n41:22 - manifestor than God he has manifested the whole of creation so what more do you want to manifest when he's already manifested creation my reasoning is this when God is already\n41:35 - manifested creation there is nothing more to manifest oh we foolish human beings are so foolish oh Lord forgive us for our pompous ego and thinking that we can\n41:48 - manifest you can manifest nothing so after he manifested creation your ego still pipes up says I want to play God and I want to manifest a little something that's playing\n42:02 - ego manifesting is humbly merging into God and becoming one with him that is the greatest manifestation you can have what more can I tell you because it's already 12:00 start\n42:27 - want to leave these people but they do not want to leave me if you tell them put up your hands if you want to carry on they'll all put up their\n42:39 - hands only three people okay put up your hands those who want to be here longer put up your hands they don't put up your hands if you want to be here\n42:52 - with me more time put up your hands they don't understand English everybody put up your hands now you see 10% results\n43:07 - okay okay last question uh G what is the importance of the Sun in human evolution what is the importance of the sun H okay\n43:31 - the the Sun and the Moon both have beneficial effects on the Cadian rhythms of the Earth on its Evolution like the sun it's warmth it\n43:46 - gives us the necessary vitamins the necessary nourishment it makes us grow it makes intelligence grow it is so vast it benefits are so\n43:60 - vast that it's impossible to pin down but if there were no sun for a year or so life on Earth would die so sun is known as the pran the life of the Earth the life of the solar system is the\n44:14 - [Music] Sun and that's why they sing no he he it's come [Music]\n44:39 - [Applause] up therefore he is the life giver and don't think he doesn't listen to a call the moment you call he will come how many noticed of you this side\n44:56 - noticed him coming when we were chanting who didn't notice it who didn't notice the sua coming when we chanted who noticed it when we coming raise your hands but there are some people who are\n45:09 - not raising their hands in any way so there's no so anyway this is he is the life of the Earth the Flesh of our flesh the blood of our blood and the soul of our souls and he is the first K yog Guru\n45:21 - the only thing is you breathe for 12 seconds up and down his one breath up and down is for 12 years so he is the God and behind him the rainning power of the sua the ball of fire has an\n45:34 - informing spirit that informing spirit is is the god of our solar system above him there's another about whom we know nothing that is the Lord God who inspires the suor\n45:50 - [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] with this\n46:22 - AR I will see means I will see you again at 5:00 or 6:00 whatever off we it all means we will meet again very nice",

          "transcript": "00:10 - [Music] pronounced so we will begin today by trying to get an idea of what\n00:38 - is yoga what is yoga all about so we have to define in simple language so you okay when you save yourself\n01:25 - foreign spheres of consciousness to get to the goddesses to get to the super consciousness which lies\n01:52 - at the core being of spirit with you is one with the universal spirit the jiva endeavor to become one where shiva\n02:19 - is you so for that inner journey you have to break all the barriers of your physical ailments your passions your emotions\n02:49 - conditionings so the construct of the mind was destroyed the mind which is conditioned was very unconditioned\n03:26 - [Applause] [Music] you have to destroy the construct of the mind because the mind is the greatest obstacle to the\n03:54 - consciousness i'm telling you these in little verses and are very much more complex but you have to go through them\n04:12 - so what is coming in the way of our own self-realization you put the hands of your mind upon the eyes of your soul\n04:27 - and cry that you cannot see take the hands of your mind off the eyes of your soul and behold [Applause]\n04:49 - [Music] so but how do you remove the hands of your mind from the eyes of your soul from the jiva how do you remove the mind\n05:04 - you see the splendor of your soul is covered with the mind of your mud the mud of your mind that mud has to be washed away by the practice of\n05:15 - pranayama that's why we do clear you to wash away the mud of the mind from the eyes of the soul then only you can behold this is very important\n05:32 - and then there are many processes you know to go from simple jobs these are the very preliminary first processes to connect your mind\n05:51 - to get your mind together then you go to the more advanced processes you know after you do your java then you go to seems to withdraw\n06:06 - from the senses then the next technique of trying to expand your consciousness to take your eyes away to take your hands away from your eyes in which undisturbed you can see the\n06:35 - image of shiva let's see for example but you see the image of shiva uninterrupted by any other but in samadhi you see the image of shivan forget yourself\n06:48 - when you forget yourself that is someone but yet you have not become shiva but you have forgotten yourself and how only focused then as you go to a subtle and subtle\n06:60 - state are traveling through various states and those people instead of visiting here and there if you look at me as\n07:19 - i transform you you will see myself disappearing and you will see yourself alone you will get the experience as i take you\n07:33 - you can experience the states as i talk to you and in samadhi you can forget yourself and only see my image and then in higher things meditation\n07:43 - techniques like pushed happy sudden awareness forget everything you can imagine yourself\n07:56 - myself disappeared into you that's how the guru actually transforms you so yoga is not just a teaching or a similar not japan it is the alchemy of total\n08:07 - transformation and that's why you when you go to people and these little seminars and satsang they give you a little i'm a good person i'm breathing health\n08:19 - and happiness all my sorrow is gone these are truth we have ten thousand people attending those sessions but when you get to the real session\n08:28 - where he makes you disappear and the master disappears and just an awareness is there between you and me to those sessions very few people come something on the other comes evolution\n08:47 - is slow as you go higher and higher either there's some damn curfew or there's some forward or they must realize the difference between a teacher's teaching\n09:09 - motivational speakers teaching motivational speakers very popular because it it gives you what you want [Music]\n09:34 - yesterday when i was taking him he said yours is the best teaching in the world i can write it and make it an affidavit and i can give it to you\n09:47 - there's nobody that's what she said but you are not giving the people what they want that struck me and what do they want influence people and make lots of money\n10:50 - this is what your spirituality in the world is today this 11th spirituality is satisfaction of the congress at the\n11:11 - sexual level what had this satsang today manly potency the technique of the union there would be 20\n11:34 - 000 people here am i right i can only compete with lady gaga on his face them [Laughter]\n13:41 - it will be very popular i know i'm giving you the best teaching in the world i'm not teaching firstly i'm giving you a transmission now i will leave you a step-by-step\n13:52 - meditation into which you will experience what i'm talking about so i'm not a teacher i can teach wrong or not\n14:00 - but the experience will be dead accurate it's the experience that is important teachers inform masters transform so with me is the anatomy of total transformation\n14:14 - so these sort of things questions they say unless you answer these sort of questions foreign so that is this is very important\n14:48 - so my advice to all the masters is don't try to get the biggest tribe crowd because the nascar's triangle the triangle goes like this the most basic things the largest\n14:59 - following is there's there's is this these personal problems after that a little narrow following is drumming and food fest\n15:20 - the spiritual consciousness of the himalayan yogis reaction that those techniques you're climbing up vascular triangle then the next stage is to give them\n15:41 - after their they have come give them surya why in surya work people they want instant satisfaction here's another instant satisfaction\n16:00 - i'm analyzing myself with you and i want the feedback you can tell me if what i'm saying can you speak my english i will speak my english\n16:24 - and once there was the whole international audience and i i said the mantra you know [Music] foreign\n16:53 - so all the people who did not understand english they said we can smell the jasmine and the lavender in the words please say it on we don't care about the\n17:02 - words we want the flavor and puna said that teachers inform masters transform the teacher must speak in english\n17:12 - the master speak in any language he will convey the message to you like i did [Applause] and get a flavor the other worldly flavor raise your hands\n17:35 - then you rise up don't breathe there you are those who didn't get the flavor now know that they were in your mind don't in the mind this is a technique to\n17:44 - hit you get you from your mind to your intuition because there's nothing to grasp there's no words to understand so you have to feel\n17:52 - you have to feel instilled awareness and that is inclusion that's part of the training also now what else is known that i go off into the sound strength of the\n18:05 - person they enjoy because i'm transmitting all the time i'm not teaching it's not the words now what i'm going to do is industry satsang\n18:16 - everybody talks about yoga and meditation and all but nobody gives it everybody all the teachers motivations they talk about mangoes hospitals\n18:28 - how nice the root is i'm trying to give you a taste of the yogic mango today i'll make creative and this is the difference between a teacher and a\n18:42 - master if a master says he's a very big master and cannot do this that he's not a master this is the linchpin\n18:51 - of the yogic journey that the master was sitting and in his very presence you can see the aura you can feel the vibration and the healing is already happening to you\n19:01 - how much is it happening raise your hand uh on the inner journey i'll try to simplify it as much as possible to tell you how yoga is an inner ascent\n19:30 - through ever more refined and ever more expanded spheres of consciousness which supports the subtle and subtle thought the lesser the thoughts of moral\n19:40 - consciousness expands so i'm taking you through this expansive sphere but before this i will relax a bit we will have some question answers\n19:51 - uh if anybody has question answers can i ask the question yes it's a question that's come on facebook so her name is yamila and she says i'm watching\n20:01 - satsang the question is does the perfect human being exist first question second question is what is the purpose of the descent of the spirit into matter\n20:15 - and the ascent of the matter into spirit i can only answer the question if she felt my vibration while i was chanting the sanskrit number asked i'm waiting for the answer if she\n20:27 - received that then she'll understand my question otherwise it will be an exercise in futility if you haven't received my friend's wish that's an exercise\n20:35 - well i'm not a teacher many of you have come here expecting there to be a teacher and you meet a madman i mean what the hell it's a shock\n20:46 - for your sensibilities you see you have to strip yourself of all coverings all strappings all hypocrisy and be as naked\n21:03 - you cannot describe the sweetness of a newborn child's cry how can you describe it the newborn child is crying in the spotless skies\n21:16 - how can you label that so that is the purity that you have to leave in your mind that is the inner journey have you typed your thing announced\n21:31 - i don't have facebook the moment you take away the stubbornness of the mind the intuition will grow first is one to one question also\n22:03 - [Music] that determination has to be lessened and please try to rely on an inner stillness yes people have some questions\n22:33 - what is the difference between fear and intuition and how are you supposed to know what it is that you're experiencing fear and intuition\n22:49 - is two poles of art everybody knows the difference i mean look fear requires energy intuition requires energy\n23:03 - the energy in fear is negative and dark it has more tamogoon in it neutrons and so that energy is dark and has been crossed the intuitive energy has only direct form\n23:20 - which is harmony and rhythm okay now this is the difference the buna dharma the bunas are small photonic movements in this earth\n23:39 - which have a dark effect of inertia and negativity and intuition are those photons of light electron which have vibrations and motions\n23:51 - of lightness and rhythm so based on the three donors of these emotions you take away the negativity and darkness of this and you take away the positive\n24:04 - electron the positivity of that the supplement you get pure energy pure energy this is the complete flow of an undifferentiated fabric of radiant light\n24:21 - language the divine mother so what is the divine mother she is the undifferentiated fabric of radiant light undifferentiated\n24:42 - but the moment that fabric is disturbed by a negative neutron or a positive electron that disturbs the individual created light\n24:54 - and that light becomes takes the form of fair energy this light takes the fact in can i explain it to you more scientifically is that good explanation did you like it\n25:07 - what is it so this satsang is a 70 to 80 percent a holy bone that i'm doing which will not grasp and\n25:34 - about 10 times dissipating the whites remind the certain nonsense the human being lives in the bedroom of\n25:53 - misery created by his own thoughts you put the hands of your mind you put the magnum misery of your eyes upon your soul that has to be removed and that can be\n26:08 - washed away by pranayama can you please not come again um [Music] and you instructed that i should\n26:42 - increase it to 72 after a month i wanted to ask you after how long can i further increase it after how much [Music] and then after the next three months 2\n27:02 - 72 mornings as the gentle abrasion of the liver transforms the stone into a chivalry as a gentle abrasion of the river transforms every counter every stone\n27:36 - into shankara so also the mental abrasion of kriya yoga transforms your jiva into shiva walking hand in hand with you i will\n28:04 - hold your hand and take you step by step i know that some of you is the first year where you just learn to walk you take one year to walk right\n28:17 - how long did you get to walk when did you start walking first year or second year you don't know when you started walking when you were\n28:43 - it goes like this so that's the one who's leading you and he never lets you fall you don't know that you start walking at one year one year that is your age\n28:55 - for practicing yoga the master will help you he will not get you forward that is the way of transforming yourself why do you want to do yoga is it\n29:05 - necessary of course it's necessary because it's your parents source it's your true nature it's like asking me is it necessary to be you of course it's necessary to be me i'd\n29:16 - rather be me than somebody else but the question is who is it for me is it my physical body no is it my eyes no\n29:25 - is it my nose no is it my my feeling of sexual satisfaction [Music] it's doubtful because that time when i get into\n29:38 - the the zone of that it appears that that's me i'm so involved in it but that's not me because it's temporary is it your intellectual glory no is it\n29:48 - your samadhi no is it your charity no is it your goodness no is it really feeling for the dolphin and aborting your own child no\n30:00 - yeah there's a human rights movement i don't want to get into that but then i want to just get eliminate everything one by one who are you\n30:12 - this is the question and this cannot be realized by me giving you a lecture for you listening to it it can be realized by practicing the techniques the means of realization\n30:32 - and one of the basic means of realization is kriya yo therefore practice fear you you realize the true nature of your being this is very very important\n30:45 - very important [Music] how to experience what are the steps towards it that's what i'm going to tell you just\n31:12 - now and make you experience it i believe there are more than this amount of people watching today i'd like those people who are not here not here in person but those are who are\n31:26 - watching from a distance to also tune in and cooperate with me i was told by one of our the assistants here that i would be able to see the\n31:34 - limited group of people but maybe it was in some other can i see the people watching on there oh that was tomorrow and other people watching today\n31:44 - yes how about them okay guys anyway imagination i can see all your nice dresses and your smiling faces and some of you know me and you know my\n31:58 - style of approach i will leave you by the hand step by step but keep your mind focused on me that also i will magnetize myself to such a degree\n32:09 - that your random thoughts will go nowhere but to me and i will lead you step by step i will take you in the north field in the field and you will be a magnet\n32:26 - you do your iron filings when you come within my field you will have no other choice but to walk me with me step by step to the holy of holies\n32:40 - you will walk with me to the holy of [Music] holies [Applause] the holy of holies where\n33:13 - stiller than stillness itself with weighted breath you will behold your rising self-son's nectar gold you will dissolve in that mystery untold\n33:43 - [Applause] so listen these are the type of ones which are nearest to what you will be experiencing today and to make you know what your minds are\n34:06 - this is this is the task which is more difficult than conquering the world to complain one of your minds in the task is before i start the session\n34:46 - yes you can don't be in your mind please don't nail your mind shift your shift here from your head shift to your heart\n35:03 - and just feel like you're eating a nice uh ice cream or something or breathe dream just be like a child of fight drop what inhibition\n35:14 - i think uh she gave evil energy and how we can prevent it from harming us what is it [Music]\n36:11 - when [Applause] yes you see when your emotions are mixed with your\n36:55 - wish to your sight those negative vibrations are limited in the indian picture you see no yes [Laughter]\n38:01 - because humanity is not at present at the stage of pure spirituality it's a step-by-step process don't have any attitude or i amness but if you have attitude\n38:30 - available to me right let know your name [Music] is this something they say let me tell you\n39:17 - that the whole world the whole solar system the whole galaxy the whole cluster the super cluster the whole universe is rotating and revolving the whole\n39:33 - movement the wealth and the west of creation is evolution the only thing is some evolve slower and some evolve quicker depending upon two factors\n39:49 - the superiority of the technique you practice which will depend upon which technique you suits you [Music]\n39:57 - and the second is the intensity or sincerity with which you practice so you're going to be involved in any any case all rivers are flowing to the ocean\n40:07 - so when i shall reach the ocean it's a question of time but for those either hearts who love the lord beyond everything\n40:18 - and love the gift beyond all christ you know those evil hearts many people are living without doing yoga i mean what's wrong\n40:34 - so nobody's denying it who called you here you came here because you thought there's some value in this otherwise it's your choice nothing in the world is\n40:45 - of value you can use that argument and win or everything in the world is of value you can use that argument so let's not go into semantics\n41:00 - and words and nuances these are all  things procrastination is the thief of time put your shoulder to the way get to the job\n41:14 - get it down don't argue because if you listen to the opinion of the world you will never get there one person said it is not attractive once there was a man an old man\n41:31 - he had a young son a grandson and a daughter they were shifting from one village to the other so the man he was there and\n41:45 - the son and the man were walking in the doctors of the friends the boy on the donkey and they kept walking next village oh my god look at that\n42:14 - selfish little boy he's sitting on the donkey and making the poor man walk hasn't even got manners in his pool so then he took the wife above the mountain\n42:28 - then they both sat down wrong cathode which is oh my god the poor donkey is being loaded by these men so they get off the dancing and when they went to the third village\n42:40 - third village they were both when [Applause] so please don't listen to public opinion\n43:22 - speak to your conscience what you think is right follow the path get to the true being whoever it may be if you have the courage of your convictions you shall\n43:33 - succeed if you do not have the courage of your convictions you will still evolve all\n44:07 - at the screen also people who are watching how many of you have got the eye on you raise your hands everybody raise your mind everybody come on\n44:27 - you see when i say drop the eyes not so easy you are dropping 60 50 60 enough for me to get it and give you the experience total i cannot be proud\n44:38 - only when i take you to the last stage where you have no thought and you are enjoying the bliss which i am giving you as a sava serving my larger self\n44:50 - my work is to serve humanity as my largest that time it will temporarily disappear that's what you're going to do the removal of the eye you know there's\n45:00 - a beautiful saying i made another shape but listen carefully because some of it goes you know you are the birds in the cuckoo's nest\n45:13 - so let it not go over this the more and more i disappear the more and more i disappear\n45:40 - the more the self as god appears foreign the more and more my eye disappears the more the sense as god appears so the atma is different and the eye is\n46:20 - different the more and more the more and more the more the more and more the more my eye death disappear\n46:28 - the more myself as god appears this is the second thing this is clearer and the first one is the more and more i disappear the more the self does god appear\n46:39 - no need to explain it explain too much you have to figure it out so this is what yoga is all about to make the eye disappear so that the sense can appear to make the\n46:50 - mud of the mind disappear so the art market appears are you people feeling a little satisfied that\n47:27 - you have been told enough so that it can satisfy you to a great extent right things have been good and how many could transform my words\n47:39 - into food and feel that they have been healed by the talk i have given so far raise your hands how many people feel that there's a healing\n47:47 - for people and you feel it is mere words right [Music] i'm just telling you that the mic if you're passing around the orbit in the\n48:60 - holes of the mic what is the purpose please don't feel shy i won't transform you in the moment all right\n50:12 - uh i just wanted to ask what is the purpose of this whole creation when a god i mean why we are modest human beings and this cycle of life and death\n50:20 - and then why beyond pure as god like your consciousness why there is so much evil suffering and crying here and we have to see god this thing while\n50:31 - you're not like god if there's a sparkling with us we are like god we are made in the perfect of god\n50:46 - but only a drop of that god is within us and we are identical to god and this drop is making its way towards the ocean it's fair and source that's what evolution and yoga is all\n50:60 - about and another lady asked that question which you read out to me she has asked the same question is it the same lady no this is somebody from on tv\n51:17 - it's like my granddaughter came to me suppose this is my granddaughter's family what is the general theory of relativity when you grow up you will understand it\n51:36 - actually the special theory of relativity of understanding is very simple the general theory is the complex one so yeah i will answer your question\n51:46 - definitely we are too small an entity in this and the question is too fast if i talk about this question it may take me a month two months\n51:58 - of a sequence of relationships or a sequence of explanations but i will answer it in brief i will to make an endeavor\n52:09 - i am not i'm not claiming that i will answer it but you will be pretty satisfied so the first question is this that we are made in the image of god\n52:21 - a drop of the ocean of god's infinite love and mercy is within the core of our own way which is known as jimatma that's when marathi we have the same\n52:32 - jiva shivaji zadali and there's a technique there's a word a mantra which god has given it which we say you know\n52:59 - okay so now the question is you can sit down comfortably i don't know if she can hear you from chandigarh you stay here with sector\n53:39 - this is [Music] [Music] [Applause] is\n54:47 - now getting to the basic question it's a good question you should wrap up i was gonna send it to my family that's a good idea or something\n55:29 - i live in vegas santa claus is coming with his toys so the basic question is if we are god why are we not perfect like god so i've answered i said that we\n56:00 - are perfect like god but the ocean is god and we are the drop in the ocean is within us so we are there the second question is that if we are there why did we at all\n56:09 - have to come here in this drop and make all the effort to go back again so here's the answer to the second question this is why\n56:17 - because we are a spark of the perfect infinite of reality which is shiva but shiva has a concert called relativity\n56:34 - reality and relativity so you as souls are all perfect in reality you have already come from the bosom of the lord mahadeva so you have experience in reality but\n56:55 - you have not the experience of relativity so therefore the soul each one of spark of god is sent into the university of life to\n57:04 - learn all your lessons in life from theft to murder to avarice to greed first as the descent of consciousness and reality into relativity that is the\n57:19 - descent the descending path is called the pravriti consciousness descends into denser and denser energy levels of matter\n57:32 - till it experiences all the pleasures of life the hardships and sorrows of life till it is saturated with every possible experience in life\n57:43 - as it comes life after life life after life life after life life after life life after life life after life rock bottom this is called\n57:55 - the where the consciousness enters this is the involution of consciousness into matter it is the system of creation thermodynamics\n58:09 - then when you hit then another cycle starts which is called from the prabhu mark when you have learned all your desires satisfied all your\n58:20 - emotions and desires of every person place and thing then you decide to go on another path which is called the solution of consciousness and matter\n58:32 - and the nibrity maha is the evolution of consciousness from matter to its parent source and when after millions and millions of life you have commit completed this cosmic\n58:44 - cycle and sit on the right hand of god god will say this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased yes because in god's eyes nothing is\n58:56 - good and nothing is bad nothing is evil and nothing is found and nothing is white and nothing is black all is as it is and because the whole wheel of creation the chakra\n59:07 - is moving in the bar so we as little atoms we are lives as we live our lives here's another share in english\n59:19 - as we live our lives down the river of earth as we live because as we live our lives down the river of years on our way to the ultimate scene a drop of that sea\n59:35 - is also in me ultimately to become that reality the drop merges in the sea because then after that i know that my body\n01:00:20 - is the same energy as the consciousness so i am in a drug a bottle of ice my consciousness is water i am in the bottle of\n01:00:32 - ice water and the ocean is also water so when the water melts by yogic practice the drop merges into motion so this is the second question first of\n01:00:46 - all is god why aren't we like what we are like second question is that why do we have to go through this rig so this is to get experience from the\n01:00:57 - university of life and get fully enlightened as we are enlightened in reality we also want to get enlightened in [Music]\n01:01:09 - relativity where you have to pass actually through the in trains of course that the entrance of the cow you have to pass through the birthing\n01:01:26 - process and the people actually pass through their villages deep and down that the practices have stopped they make a cow they're going to walk to\n01:01:35 - the entrance of that cow and come out of the [Music] you must know this people have studied this so the second question is\n01:01:57 - against knowledge but why is it necessary to be done because he will not be complete in knowledge you must have knowledge not only of the good but of\n01:02:05 - the bad and the good i does it satisfy your intellect yes now secondly if the consciousness i must have perfected consciousness let\n01:02:21 - the buddha the christ have to go through all the entrails of the cow being praised why does it have to go through the process of work\n01:02:32 - and they deliberately but some people choose not to do that they just they just do this to themselves and they appear in the locus\n01:02:49 - [Music] the light being standing still so they choose it another thing to realize is that if the spirit lingered and did\n01:03:06 - not come into the lower stratas or manifestation the whole earth you and i the trees and the plants and the animals the wildlife the flora and the fauna\n01:03:20 - would all be inert and dead matter so to bring property in creation to bring she cannot move unless she is vivified\n01:03:40 - by shiva she has to vivify herself by shiva and unless the shiva gravifies the shakti and the spirit comes into matter behind every thought behind every atom\n01:03:56 - behind every molecule was the spirit of god then your creation becomes alive otherwise the purpose of creation would be defeated\n01:04:03 - it's a very deep answer please take thank you for what i'm saying this is how creation functions i hope i have answered most of the question that you've asked\n01:04:25 - right yes anybody any more questions of course these are questions which are not usually asked and people are not prepared but\n01:04:39 - this is the logic behind it because shakthi wants to she wants to bring shiva she has to bring so the symbol of shakti is always\n01:04:54 - you see every time if you give a small everyday example it is two people going on a date man and woman it's okay for one month two months three\n01:05:03 - months one year then the woman says can you please it's always the woman who asks this to settle down because of the hormone of oxytocin\n01:05:31 - she is the one who says let's settle rocket in deep space now we've had enough now can we settle no no i think you should have it\n01:05:51 - that trap does not have the hormone of oxytocin oxytocin is a chemical in the body which gives the woman a desire to build a house\n01:06:01 - and have a baby [Music] so this is the nature of nature this is important and then when that foreign\n01:07:10 - is the creation have you got it what is what are the facilities for this have you made any other facility over there next time is prepared for the\n01:07:22 - next satsang see that all the importance are here like this mike and all child should also be there [Music]\n01:07:45 - so any questions this was a very nice question and i'm happy that that madame may we know your name yes what is coming out from here\n01:08:37 - is are you ready to walk with me step by step to the subtle and subtler realms of your own mind raise your hands put your\n01:09:17 - to walk with me step by step you",

the sooth drama it strings us like a necklace of pearls all of us said pearls strung on the essential string of a being called the Sutra on a string solely and in that string of this divine\n02:26 - soul astonished all our personalities of past present and future lives therefore I say unto you the 11th commandment the 10 you already know the 11th commandment a worth piece is to herald the dawn of\n02:50 - the new age let us all realize that humanity is are uniting religion breath are uniting prayer and consciousness are uniting God Army uses today's gathering and\n03:28 - congregation today's satsang is an experiential satsang because in Toronto and in the states in many a Greek people have come and they've talked and they thought that\n03:44 - they talked about God and spiritual matters about yoga and expanded consciousness but now the people of Toronto and the people of the states are saying we want the walk a guru\n04:01 - put your money way about this I said ok dear Souls I do that I will give you an experiential sub son but talk is also fun it's interesting because your minds are so tuned to speaking that you\n04:15 - getting close by talks that is your experience but if you have had really experiences in a very controlled conditions saying that I will give you such an experience that that experience\n04:27 - comes to you this is not - not done the show that I am somebody special it is done to inculcate in your deep of faith that the Lord God and his virtues that is his powers his cities his\n04:47 - virtues do exist and any soul who is pure enough can transmit the spiritual experience to his brothers and sisters who are sitting amongst us in the congregation today I so get ready for\n05:10 - the experiential sat-sun but I will give you an experience after I finish you should talk part of it then we will do the walk part of it ok I brought a message for you if you people can you\n05:30 - people hear me at the back who you know here we who can you people hear me at the back when I speak like this can you hear me now that's comfortable so I bring this message and a gift to you\n05:50 - fastest of the Himalayas of India be the architect be the architect of your own happiness be the architect of your own happiness the secret lies in your breath and the breath is called Kriya yoga dear\n06:26 - Souls this is not a religion or cult or creed it's much selfing into the self it's about you a scientific process of an approach to the supreme reality is nondenominational it belongs to no\n06:50 - religion culture of trade it belongs to humanity itself because it is to do with your breath and I think that the whole of humanity breeds I that is our religion but if you don't want to be in\n07:10 - our religion you're free to not do it it's basic ok the manatee has a cult and a green it's old breathe do you like that does it feel good as the word breathe infuse and\n07:30 - inspire you to a sense of freedom I would like to breathe raise your hands ok now this is the talk now the work who would like me to breathe through your breath raise your hands but not like\n07:48 - that raise your hands ok what would this do you breathing and be breathing through your bed what message would it send you can anybody tell me say anything free\n08:05 - there's a small family gathering when one family is gathered us all unite oh yes yes what is the connectors about what is the connectors connect I of humanity and\n08:18 - anybody can be what is that one thing that you manatee does which is the same it breeds breath has no religion it has no tree it has no color if you have some other rules which many of you have gurus\n08:33 - and teachers and masters some of you also they say that your gurus teachers and masters but my breathing will not come in the way of your ideology or your denomination right I so we will breathe\n08:49 - through the breath I think you should do this inside so the first thing we do should be prepared for that when I tell you that humanity is tired by the self-same\n09:10 - thought of breath through love see home this bull just this blue is just speaking about how many demonstrating they don't even have a concept that a true master can release his desires and\n09:29 - attachment to his body and breathe through all of you at the same time you'll only get it if you want to get it if you're mine named of yours you will get a very mind experience and if you're\n09:41 - totally open it depends upon the degree of your openness to my experience but I'm giving it identity to every so to me it's not a big deal to serve you but for you it is a big deal to accept a gift\n09:60 - which has never been given before which is already your own a gift it shows you that humanity is connected one to the other in 2007 when I went to the United Nations to talk I give this experience\n10:17 - and I said they said why are you giving this experience I said this is to demonstrate to the warring words this is to demonstrate to the warring countries that brothers and sisters do not fight\n10:30 - because we breathe the same breath we live of the same essence of the Lord who has no religion credit or creed but has only supreme truth and reality for its basis and that's what I have\n10:47 - come to give you the basis of your own being and the essence of your own being but give it to you gently that love not to gatecrash into your mind or trespass into your process of Fort Edmonton only\n11:08 - if those who are accepting it and who like the experience and he was dropped to find and open your heart and free I read through all your breath is your breath so it's community in humanity 24\n11:24 - or community humanity come unity or manatee forget it be the souls all of us as souls are meditated to the furthering of human awareness all these souls are meditated\n11:54 - to the furthering of human awareness all these souls are dedicated to serving humanity as I as I said all these souls are devoted to new life awakening for earth peace healing to send PC this is\n12:20 - the vision and the vision statement which I've written it's universal now I will go on to tell you the secret of happiness lies in your breath we're not only your spiritual\n12:45 - progress takes place by the breathing of the Kriya practice but also by the buyer and his desires that you have are fulfilled as you practice your Kriya yoga commensurate with your individual\n13:02 - karma in fact many false hopes I must give you both I must give you happiness but there's one thing which comes in the way to people meditating for a car ready Ferrari cars what am i get it in three\n13:17 - months the other may take six years they cannot justify the difference why I got in just because your car became in the way what did you have in the past they came in the late person only do you got\n13:28 - it so there's the difference person meditating for an octree he making it that's desire fulfilled in three months another may not get it at all say hey\n13:43 - Weiss what is this you want did the practice that we have what didn't get it one because if you see the backside of the stitching for you ladies of them stitching the flowers look very good in\n13:52 - the crocheted equality you know crochet what if the back is very icky so they may produce rose using you know the back this or problems their problems and we have prevented you from getting so\n14:10 - justice is great for everyone but each according to their karma Newton's third law of motion every action has an equal and opposite reaction someday lead over of the negativity you will also get the\n14:23 - lottery this can be very cruel than material examples if search for God everybody will find God seven in three three months seven thirty years some half to three lives but find him they\n14:39 - will because God is the essence of the nature of your being hi [Applause] you know why I stopped after every\n14:57 - sentence over the sentence and gravitas they have made and a skull some two centimetres few millimeters thick not centimeters and it takes time to sink so I give the time so that you can\n15:09 - understand what is being said I just want a little feedback I'm talking you can hear the talk but how how many can feel my words is tangible and relaxing your muscles and making you feel calm\n15:23 - how many can feel the words is something tangible a chance of that is sensory give yourself a hand it's not the first time or one of the few times where you can really feel it\n15:37 - was right you know what it is what you're feeling that is the truth which is lived with piranhas have you ever brought many of you have done moving all that I how many of you heard of the word\n15:50 - front okay so this is this is brown at his best chronic healing and Reiki not they have to sit still when the yogi comes at the hole because he is full of fraud he is\n16:04 - full of Chaitanya both of it be fiercely please fight I've not come to give us injection insulin injection so much when you smile anybody told you that you look much better in Italy it takes less\n16:25 - muscles of the face facial muscles to smile tend to frown so why waste excess energy and not smile I'm gonna tell you about the science of career you free are you is the science of life force energy\n16:50 - [Music] then done with concentration leaving you to meditation and then expanding into the ecstasy of some money your body has two currents which sustain it\n17:12 - what is the product current which flows from the perineum that is the mooladhara chakra up the spine to the entire chakra inverse Allah that is the chronic current it is rejuvenating and evolves\n17:34 - your consciousness it rejuvenates your body cells and evolves your consciousness the other current is the apana current which flows from the mind near the third eye down the spine to the\n17:50 - base chakra the root chakra this is called the tonic current which burns all your asked evil karma in detoxes your body so Kriya yoga at its most crosses level and I'll give it this word for you\n18:08 - it's a rejuven detox technique now you can grasp or do business first you have to give like I say chocolate refers to a child strawberry chocolate make chocolate white profit unless you give\n18:22 - it in his hands and he opens it and seasoned so white chocolate and eats it then he understand it that's what I intend to do there with you to give you the Quranic breath I so this is the\n18:39 - rejuven detox technique the awkward breath of the pranic correct rejuvenate your body cells with a downward breath burns your negativity and your past evil karma at the deeper level they are\n19:02 - called bread the spiritual evolution the downward breath is karmic in solution therefore done with intense concentration one cycle of Kriya yoga\n19:13 - and down is equal to one year of natural spiritual unfoldment this is called the airplane part or the lightning part of the evolution apart who doesn't want to see the guard with\n19:25 - it themselves who doesn't want to see a parent sauce a supreme body a real monster but they somehow I imagine some who buy meditations on both a contemplation but the fastest is free\n19:39 - are you and then going to someone eagle hearts cannot wait therefore the practice the clear you so when you practice this concession incessant breathing it runs off the\n20:00 - rough edges of your personality you find yourself becoming calm and say hey how do you train you becoming so far doesn't glow on your face what's that you I can see it but I cannot see it but I can\n20:15 - describe it and when I meet you I really very happy I think I've reached home but when you give that feeling to another person then you are said to be fairly deeply advanced in creative their voice\n20:30 - you will become very deep it will start affecting other people your personally blow these are the benchmarks of a successful tree I know you will do old but you will not feel old and you will\n20:46 - make others feel young so this is dependent on the concentrated breathing of the bread is clearing of Kriya means to do and what it does it takes away your negativity in this life and infuses\n21:05 - you the effulgent radiance of a positive attitude you have any pollutant radiance of positive attitude I got it the slow breathing of priam slow breath if a man is willing I'd say what is the\n21:32 - human bet 60 seconds 60 times of a network when he turns on at the CP I know daughter's grades four times in a minute it lives 500 years elephant live brings sixteen times of in it it gives a\n21:47 - good over 100 years a human being he reads the words 50 to 60 is four times a minute and he lives 80 to 90 years don't we reading very very fast especially the penny penny big dogs they don't like a\n22:02 - pedigreed great setter or great day these are God's they live eight to nine years so the faster the baby unless the life have you understood I have I created you instead of meeting\n22:19 - 60 times if you breed only 15 or 12 times if you breathe slower you can prolong your life because you have been sanctioned a certain everyone is destined and sanctioned a certain amount\n22:35 - of breaths if you finish those breaths you have to leave the body put it going to another higher have it well thought you would come and be reincarnated again to about\n22:47 - the backlog of your other karma and unless your karmic ledgers complete you will not get moksha or liberation of salvation is that very clear I so when you practice Kriya you firstly your\n23:03 - heart is rested that's where it is cause you're breathing slower so that oxygen is kept to rejuvenate your body cells secondly then you breathe slower suppose you example you have to breathe 60\n23:20 - [Music] 21600 friends in 24 hours they say a human being takes 21600 breaths 24 how many have heard of this number of safe yeah that's right now my career have you\n23:36 - believe only half the amount you you have to live say tears by that and you instead of that every day theoretically if you say you lengthen your breath is only able to breathe\n23:50 - instead of 21600 of living 10800 okay that's half the amount of breath so that means you live 160 years and we know the logic of it you understand so the slower the breath so\n24:06 - this needs to activity now we are not interested in not guarantee or immortality okay let me make this clear we are interested in humidity and bottom not an immortality of activity but why\n24:18 - do we want to live number at all or instead of disease decay and death let me live a long and healthy life so I practice Kriya yoga and in this life I can merge my drop into your ocean\n24:31 - that is the person cannot be with you I don't you like what I say because all of us are like-minded people you have one thing in common you all want to seek supreme reality\n24:47 - whatever we you may be a carpenter we may be a soldier a baby you give you may be an artist a designer but one thing is in our hearts what is the mystery of life and death O Lord and what happened\n25:02 - it what do I see where do I go I need me because I am subconsciously there is a fear the first I am afraid of the unknown and secondly I don't know I mean it's an identity crisis I don't\n25:17 - want to lose my identity my money my friends my nostalgic place is my little likes and dislikes I want it what will happen when I die I lose my identity one and then the other one that I have for\n25:31 - this had requested that most probably tomorrow they will be showing a documentary called wings to freedom my life in the Himalayas there's another documentary after that tomorrow one\n25:45 - documentary we showed you the other one is life after death which is a little advanced one and we can only see I don't know how you'd arrange it when I go you can still\n25:56 - come and fill up the hole and stick through it I'll be there when I talk you would feed my job as a material substance okay so now I am explaining I have explained you what Kriya Yoga is\n26:13 - now for a short while even have precision our muscles I'm going to be very tight on the time because I want to give you the experience and don't want to be carried away in question answers\n26:25 - but we will have question answers if there's any question answers about the science of 3:09 for senate a comfo yes that's what i'm going to tell you tomorrow when you come for the\n26:52 - initiation that will be discussed in detail that is the active technique which I will be giving you tomorrow along with the state of expanded consciousness you have to speak slowly\n27:29 - and I think you'll it could you tell me when I said humanity is on uniting religion the other thing in matter even if it's a distance I cannot hear that the words rule over know that you can\n27:51 - give a gap between each one yeah so this must be in my life experience I can already tell that she's your friend receive sure the name on that I\n28:26 - am on simulation here you asked the question yes and it happens to many people's questions announcer and that will not give you a panic attack but it may give you a certain question I'm not\n29:14 - reading an attack where I should be because the breath is so slow so that is the motor action of your past what you're used to having a fear for that I showed you the experience that no fear\n29:29 - no fear when I am near okay I will be there and whenever you fall on me and I will be through your breath this is a message to humanity you take it at the high tide look you have enough time they\n29:44 - have to do what we have to do let the water carrier messages and this is a scientific process now your question is no garage they either call me mark or your garage how should we know who to\n30:04 - take initiation from how should we know who is a true master there is a supermarket of gurus here and they attract thousands of people there is a true guru dependent upon the\n30:16 - about the people here facts these are questions if he attracts 5,000 people he is very blue movie attracts 10,000 is greater not at all it hasn't happened depend on that because the masses of the\n30:30 - people innocent gullible and they go for the after show so the first answers never take things by the outward show for the feather flies high but the colonized row so to\n30:48 - mazda miata small gathering it's not necessary so that is important I never they take things by the Alfred show if there's a big man is a big show and big the posters Anderson I thought the\n31:03 - category you may be assured with showman our associate leader but to get a true spiritual master you have to look for some in deeper what is that something you have\n31:30 - experienced is the substance experienced if he said I realized master breached on the break of everyone and then he goes with nothing he must show you and breathe through your breath and if he\n31:43 - doesn't then he must do it a day for your sake we are here to serve you as our Naga said I thought these are two things these are the two hints the many are no matter how many people I'm just\n32:27 - because I'm a single mom with one childish dress and I've seen a lot of our healers have died or have been threatened so as I rise to do what I was supposed to do on my journey is there\n32:42 - anything that you could tell me and I'm positive way to keep me could I have focused on that my journey so I'm not [Music] questioning all of these leaders who are\n32:58 - here did Jesus tell you that usually have you a certificate from him but it will not tell you that price to tell you I'm sorry to tell you or Krishna if these people tell you or are you\n33:18 - bring it on your own whatever goodness to serve humanity it's an innocence that you're doing it so your soul my message to you it's first have a million dollars in\n33:33 - your package before you came to me bring me here I think you can understand I have several million in my bank so donating a million to you today but\n33:46 - what we don't have a big deal you have millions but if you donate a million then and you have 50 billion and you donate what we give your whole business will give you stop till you go to\n33:58 - bankruptcy you have to have a million to donate a million and a trillion to donate another video you have to have so much of spiritual energy and power that you can give away power and healing and\n34:12 - tremendous power and healing goes when you when you cry to eat others they have said that this is healing I'm standing aside the master is this himself appointed themselves the leaders people\n34:27 - themselves of appointed their masters and we bloom them separately here and there for many people they Foley some people get attacked you know I don't know whatever the reasons are\n34:43 - these are arbitrary missions to deep in the past complex situation of their karma which they cannot see in this life what I would advise a leader his first take the protection of a master son who\n35:01 - were ranked austere how would you know the grand master he will be giving floods of time when he many greens through a web not only this one will receive it but people in New York and\n35:17 - Honolulu island in Hawaii will also start reading those who are include with me in India and Africa and Australia they will also be this must be the pranic power of the master who is\n35:29 - protecting him he should be alive after having taken permission from you he'll obviously guide you but don't do it six times a day from it three times a day or two times a day because his idea is not\n35:42 - to make you here and in others but to protect you as a disciple first get your spiritual power tense time this he leaned on he is doesn't come on the spiritual path it doesn't cover the\n35:54 - spiritual progress so this is a four part in healing you get a satisfaction it's okay I don't want to get into that but when you do the Kriya yoga I will be protecting you and when I have patreon\n36:08 - the dream I will give you the message if I don't appear in the dream then you catch me personally and ask me face-to-face why do you have a focal you ask the photo that you are safe okay so\n36:19 - the idea is to protect you maybe one of the reasons you come here is to get the protection if anybody thinks he's come here by accident or just for fun let me tell you you're mistaken you've all been\n36:32 - guided and been sent here it's a divine plan but if you don't take the high time and miss the opportunity that enough to flounder in the shadows for the next year and I cough okay lay somebody at\n36:46 - the back yes no I cannot talk about it because I have no time I have to give me that I have to did I have to give you an experience or talk about now I'm giving would you\n37:06 - rather me talk about it or you can experience mostly moments of talk region's most experienced me there that's what it's going to be sir it is more than answer right there happy to\n37:20 - taste it I'm just giving you a light menu card and everything but I'm going to be the food directly and not the food with you oh you like that you want I give you the that you need this is for\n37:33 - spillage and everything yes definitely but you must see the pasta mistake maybe you wouldn't see me you will connect with me when I show you something today I'm going to get on for that giving me -\n37:55 - am i sadi with you also and then you see certain pieces like a new picture of Moses or Chevy Saibaba but you have a face you see then I will tell you what that connection is with me you\n38:11 - understand and you will see it if you can't if you come with a pure heart and just sit and just observe and you will see the aura around you the seven colors combined according to your attention and\n38:23 - you will see who I am and then assign yourself this is the experience is ready so they happen very fast yes surgery open out is this Bible word China's what is the move and they open the barrel\n40:09 -

had it I had to be grouped so I said listen it how many of you have had stick your toffee this one I took this in America so they release their hands so then I said for how many of you I was\n42:36 - telling you the aura blurriness of all of us how ordinary and beautiful here I said for how many people as the stick your prophet stuck on top of the pallet the order is the handsome so then I said\n42:48 -

[Laughter] you do leave with the death of a loved one there's nothing to be tried out cry it out cry out years out and then you'll\n45:35 - get to the deeper essence or emotion of crying then we go to the steady calm that any book of the steady common thought you will see that your inner consciousness can never die will connect\n45:47 - you to the consciousness of the of the one who is not dead but has left a body behind you see birth and death I'm here chapters of the life story say to yourself both and then and\n46:13 - there I'm here chapters in our story just unbalanced but we'll miss your practice and the balance will come automatically a baby does not try to when your own David is not try to\n47:11 - maintain its balance it just goes on its own way is the problem of the mother to maintain the balance of the baby be like that Marlon faster than document in your balance practice video sincerely and he\n47:22 - will do the balance [Applause] [Laughter] and when you're suppose they're representing you have to cook your faith\n47:41 - in it it will happen this as it happened to thousands of people all their income and even I didn't know that I could do it but they told me you came and you did I said well I didn't see myself\n47:52 - commodity but you say you saw my phone god bless - and I'm happy for you I practice Kriya yoga regularly that's what I can do okay so there certainly was there certainly bookings that I\n48:07 - would agree so that's why the master was really--it leave the thing if he comes as a server of humanity not to teach you what to serve you and therefore the people weren't in his disciples remedy\n48:18 - go the moment any moments their spiritual progress begins yes carry on carry on yes you just come up here yes myself just started good morning night I see\n48:60 - sometimes very very light light and I get this like they told us to follow my friend some of your recordings and feel the breath becoming the same as if you didn't feel that it to the market\n49:30 - anything with me to YouTube type then the YouTube the master who speaking I'm speaking there then I would guide you that is the power of the YouTube for a living master I think in transmitted he\n49:42 - in true easy mm and tens of thousands of people have tried it and they've been able to my YouTube they haven't even completely so I would advise you to come to the Kriya yoga tomorrow intake and\n49:60 -

does either's reign in trauma healing all at the same time on everyone and if ninety nine ninety five percent you see me removing two percent three percent don't and you know what the problem is\n50:31 - your mind is interfering so I'm going to give if you're - I said let me tell you five music or if you're on heavy medication you do some cancer also schizophrenic meditation then I don't\n50:44 - crash through that to disturb the main imbalance yes [Music] [Music]\n52:35 - this is my last night yeah one morning and you have the opportunity to practice you could even break the barrier of paper model if you practice properly out of the ascended masters can you name one\n52:53 - which you saw or which one you are attracted to the shaman is way way beyond to the ascent so out of the bunny on the contrary usually taught me because she is the\n54:03 - epitome if he takes her if he if she takes perform such as a exceeding feminine beauty that you will dissolve I'm not seeing there may be certain ladies or not to have any men seen such\n54:22 - a beautiful girl that is all I don't think they are so powerful that this movement will only on the women the men also should be very handsome to take on head on that's me but Kali is the most\n54:37 - spirited us and she will give you a shot that is the Shakti behind everyone the most beautiful form of kuru okay sit next question god bless you know you your question you have to\n54:55 - your turn raise your hand wondering what is one of your most beautiful [Applause] and the golden a blue in between and the\n56:39 - dead center of synthetic I star everyone will see the same thing so they're already dating people in the who and what you wanna experience everybody else is also experiencing because there are\n56:50 - people on the subject and they have all meditated so it's quite a from the first stage is quite a high group of people it's not only in us so don't worry their breathing problems in from the throne I\n57:03 - thanks question yes what did I do just now I'm also a professor I profess to have spiritual knowledge I started singing I professed and I had and I am virtually gave you\n57:60 - the experience of love when I was camping all their bodies became night you became Shin on a fire so to make your vessels to give the experience of his or to talk yeah because your money\n58:11 - where your mouth is you have to walk the talk as I say I'm gonna leave to your branch I should actually give them the experience so it's very difficult to be a professor it's good it's easy to be a\n58:22 - teacher a teacher it informs and the South Pole Alaska transforms so the professor something I came to a master but not a master the bishop didn't himself a little bit of practical you\n58:37 - know some technique or some method whereby they get count themselves a little technique you know like sitting in the evenings are for sitting by the water and evening and breathing in the\n58:47 -

          "transcript": "00:08 - [Music] ah [Music] a jolt of lightning in the impending Gloom this is mental radio the show with\n00:34 - your mind and mind I'm Shadow Stevens and Dr free good afternoon we have quite a a unique uh day plan for us here today on mental radio and Shadow uh just briefly last night you went to see our\n00:45 - guest in studio guest right now Yogi Raj who's in our studio we'll introduce in a second and tell us if you will please what uh what you saw last night was to be expected and we'll talk about so much\n00:54 - well there's a there's a lot of of experience there was a fire ceremony that was quite um uh empowering and uh shiv aot I guess is what you call it huh the the experience of um Consciousness\n01:08 - uh thoughtless awareness let's have uh Yogi Raj explain these things to us but first welcome to mental radio thank you um I have a question for you as a as a holy man what do you say to an\n01:26 - atheist do you just let it go or do you don't engage or do you try are there things that you can say that um that will make will open someone up to the possibility that jeez maybe there could\n01:38 - be something bigger through their through their sneering through their their their their cynicism well we just let the atheist be as he is let him\n01:53 - go till the time comes when he evolves and he refines himself to experience extra sensory perceptions so does that usually come\n02:10 - with some kind of pain not necessarily it comes by living life by living a disciplined Life by living a purer life the\n02:22 - human soul the human consciousness expresses itself through various layers of matter and mind to express its own Divinity so why do you tell me this why\n02:39 - do we use the word god well I don't use the word god others may use it it's just something to pin your thoughts on because God Is So infinite I'd rather call\n02:56 - him he about whom we know nothing or I'd rather call him the non-being essentiality or he whose Center is everywhere and circumference nowhere because God is well beyond the\n03:14 - mind and how can you describe something about a person who is a being who is beyond mind with a limited mind you cannot do it so words fail you when you try to start articulating these\n03:28 - things I suppose it's very much like U an an a higher awareness when you say that you've experienced U samat of God Consciousness putting that in words Ecstasy of expanded\n03:43 - Consciousness an ecstasy of expanded Consciousness this Ecstasy of expanded Consciousness is one small aspect of he about whom we know nothing then what is Christ\n03:57 - Consciousness what is Christ consciousness now Christ Consciousness as we have in yoga there are two states one is self-realization\n04:07 - and the other is God realization self-realization is Christ Consciousness and God realization is beyond that is Cosmic Consciousness now when you are in\n04:25 - relativity in the laws of cause and effect you experience experience the vision and the operations of many sages and Saints and actual presences come before you as you refine your\n04:41 - psychological system as your extrasensory perceptions refine themselves you're able to look into deeper dimensions and subtler dimensions and what's the method of that how do you\n04:53 - achieve that well you achieve that by the practice of yog by the practice of pranayam by continuously deto toxifying your system you see the body is carbon based and the practice of Kaa yog is to\n05:05 - decarbonize the body when you decarb the body Your Body Mind and Spirit the soul gets purified and by this purification technique you are able to delve into\n05:17 - deeper Realms and subtler Realms of the world so this is called the saal samadi where there is vulp there is thought and form which is self-realization you realize yourself to be the\n05:34 - Consciousness in All Souls but there's still form attached to this but when you get to the formless state of an ecstasy of expanded Consciousness this formless state is\n05:47 - known as nirvikalp samadi that state of ecstasy which has no thought and form and this is beyond Christ Consciousness this is God Consciousness I'm confused because a\n05:60 - moment ago you said you don't use God as the word so can you define the difference I am I am using it for people who are very used to using this word god Consciousness which is God Consciousness\n06:12 - which is listen do you get it so if I do this all the time the the audience won't understand what I'm talking about so just just as a nom clut are just\n06:24 - something to pin on I use the word god it's just a facility it's it's a question of M dialect it's not it's not an essential fact because God is not a subject of intellectual speculation or\n06:40 - discussion for thousands of years people have been trying to prove God and they have failed for thousands of years people have trying to disprove God they have also failed right because God is\n06:53 - not a subject of proving or disproving he is of direct experience and and each one must validate this Truth by his own experience so what is freedom of choice\n07:09 - what as human beings what do we have as Freedom of Choice your freedom of choice comes when you transcend your mind as long as your mind plays\n07:24 - relativity as long as your mind is thinking it'll be biased by its past thoughts it'll be biased by recalled memories and therefore to get Beyond thought into a state of a still mind\n07:44 - awareness from that state of still mind awareness you can make whatever choice you want on the crystal clear table of your mind can a pure unbiased decision be\n07:57 - made as long as your thoughts swear your mind it'll be biased it'll pendulum swing to one side or the other you have to transcend your thoughts get to the still mind State pure awareness and then\n08:12 - you can make your decision now what about people that have no idea what you're talking about people that uh are just kind of lost in the illusion and and don't understand the need for a\n08:23 - higher power or the tremendous amount of discipline that it takes to say I am going to apply myself every day to finding to gaining some kind of conscious awareness and have these kinds\n08:35 - of experiences that you're talking about do they just have to wait until something miraculously pings them no there are simpler techniques it's like a school a\n08:47 - university the first grade second grade third grade till you reach the PHD so the first graders they use by prayer then they do ch chanting singing of\n09:02 - hymns chanting the Holy Name of Jesus or Krishna or Ram this chanting helps them to focus their mind on a particular object and this helps them to\n09:19 - concentrate by prayer or by chanting these are first stages then they get to higher states of say the rhythmic breathing of pranayam then they take more Advanced\n09:30 - stages after being purified and detoxified by pranayam and having a crystal mind they take to the practice of concentration which is bringing wward\n09:41 - thoughts repeatedly back to the focus of attention this training your thoughts to concentrate on the object which you're supposed to concentrate is the practice of\n09:53 - concentration then they go to a higher state when this effort is not required and the thoughts wander no more then the river of concentration opens up into the Esty of\n10:03 - meditation where you don't have to row the boat the boat moves by the momentum of the past effort of rowing that is meditation and when the Esty expands into the ocean and the boat and the roar\n10:16 - is lost in the ocean of bliss that is samadi or the Ecstasy of expanded Consciousness so it's a natural flow of human nature we had a guest on our show uh just recently was talking about\n10:28 - something similar that uh that when he saw God as he put it that there was so much ecstasy so much Elation so much Bliss that that he just people simply couldn't handle that can you relate to\n10:39 - that or what people are fearing there when you see God in his completest truth nobody comes back to tell the tale\n10:55 - those who know it tell it not those who tell it know it not so I will not speak about the final Mysteries here because they cannot be comprehended or spoken about the moment I speak it I limited I\n11:12 - limit God I limit that ineffable all-encompassing nothingness from which the everything is made we can just point\n11:24 - in that direction but cannot talk about it or comprehend it in our limited Minds because he is beyond mind okay I have another one how do you describe what is love cuz I you get to this place where\n11:37 - you go every love and as if as if it's a tangible thing that you touch grab or do something with other than to give to be there for others but when you when you it's really easy to u to talk about love\n11:52 - when you're talking about your your family your wife your children and and being there for them and the the magn magnetism that you have but when you get beyond that they say love God what does\n12:04 - that mean how do you how do you manifest love God well to grasp the concept you have to start from the very base there's a thing called lustful love where a man or an animal lusts for\n12:22 - a woman so that his desire of love which is shrouded in lust and passion is fulfilled it's very raw it's at the very animal stage at the very passional stage\n12:37 - from lustful love from thousands of years of evolution it becomes passional love this is the evolution of the seed of love because the seed of love starts from lust and goes higher and higher\n12:55 - from passional love as man evolves it is the evolution of love he evolves to the higher state and goes to emotional love you see the relationship the Congress of the sexual Union is always there but\n13:11 - along with it it gets more and more refined then people instead of grabbing one another with animal force and relating they tend to sit side by side and listen to some beautiful music and\n13:22 - then they relate and it becomes from lustful love to passional love to emotional love this further re defines and divinize itself to devotional love where the people think of each other as\n13:34 - a god and goddess like in the Indian Tantra yog you have that it is the union of a goddess and a God where you honor and respect one another when you relate and that's when spiritual children are\n13:47 - born due to a holy Union a communion a Holy Communion is devotional love and then from devotional love you go to a yet higher stage which is divine love so this is the mystery of love this is\n14:02 - the secret of Love That lust itself gets transformed and evolved into Divine love so nothing can be left out nothing can be put in it all culminates in the Divine does it ever stop at just the\n14:14 - last stage does it always progress into the Divine love after it goes into Divine love you go over the top and then there comes what is called the sacrifice and out of a compassion the\n14:30 - second Advent of Christ comes this second Advent is a pure overflowing of divine love and this transforms itself into compassion and because of compassion the K avar descends on Earth\n14:44 - again to lab liberate and save Humanity the second Advent of Christ comes not because he wants anything from Humanity but he knows their suffering he is the soul of their suffering and out of a\n14:55 - sheer compassion wanting nothing in return he comes again again and again to liberate his children's soul and take them to the state that he already is this is the grandar and the Majesty that\n15:08 - love and lust end in the greatest of sacrifice that's why people like the Christ and the Krishna and shiv goraka babaii are called and the Buddha are called the Great sacrifice mahab\n15:24 - bishar the thing that that many people use who who don't believe in a God or higher power as they have trouble with the idea that there is so much pain there's so much suffering\n15:38 - why that's the question and then they go if there's a God if there is a higher power why would he put U beings through this why do you want to blame God for your own actions whose reactions you\n15:55 - must suffer getting to the basic point of it it is called the law of karma the basic law of Karma and aspect of karma is Newton's third law of motion which is every action has an equal and opposite\n16:09 - reaction if you bump your head against a wall and cry that God punished you it's not God's fault you bumped your head hard your head is bleeding if you bump your head slowly you'll get less\n16:22 - pain but instead you see if you plant a thorn tree and expect figs or mangoes from it you cannot get it so you must reap what you have sown this is the law of karma underlying the justice of\n16:36 - humanity so those people who are suffering had done such deeds in their past lives where they deserved this suffering those people who are rejoicing in wealth and in in pleasure had done\n16:49 - certain certain actions to earn that wealth or to do something which they deserve this pleasure for therefore they're enjoying this pleasure so the law of karma answer\n16:60 - the suffering and the joy which prevails upon this Earth it is the law of all laws and the uh and the suffering generally triggers an action in people to reach for something more to question\n17:14 - everything and go what do I have to do to get rid of this suffering okay I'll do it uh meditate pray reach for ask and that's what happens right yes this is what\n17:25 - happens because your individual present expl aains your individual past to each one is allotted his exact and proper task to the truth is truth begot the liar gets his own so do no such actions\n17:41 - whose reactions you would moan this is from my poem that called karma that makes I like that so so do do the proper actions and get the proper results sometimes you get it in the next\n17:54 - life sometimes you get it in this life but get it you must because it's every action has an equal and opposite reaction is there a turnaround point for those that uh that would listen and and\n18:05 - and become enlightened and at one point look back or they can reflect back on their own perhaps Bad Karma in this life and then of course improve it can they be enlightened certainly the turnaround\n18:17 - point is this let's take a practical example okay I owe you a million dollars till I owe you a million I'll keep paying it to you because that's action and reaction the law of third law of\n18:27 - motion once I paid you a million dollar there comes the turnaround point then you don't have to fleece another fellow of a million dollars or borrow it from him then get your own earning make your\n18:38 - own effort and meditate on your own to get to higher states of ecstasy and awareness where with that great peace which you have in your heart you can share with\n18:47 - Humanity not wanting anything in return and that's where the human beings s become Superior and equal unto Celestial and divine beings where he he keeps doing good for others with no\n19:02 - return so when it's not a barter when it's not a trade then you can supersede the the cycle of action and reaction give and take night and day joy and sorrow life and death because the\n19:17 - balance of the universe is rooted in reciprocity and if you want to get above the law of Karma and reciprocity of give and take you must break the cycle of karma you must break the reciprocity\n19:33 - and go beyond it and sacrifice yourself selflessly for the benefit of humankind can you have abundance oh wait a minute hold that thought I'm so caught up in this conversation I forgot that we have\n19:45 - to do commercials here too so let's let's do that okay we'll come back in just a moment with an amazing conversation with yogi Raj with mental radio continues in a\n19:57 - moment a show with unexpected treasures and bluebirds circling overhead this is mental radio the show with your mind in mind I'm Shadow Stevens good afternoon I'm Dr Freez and in studio with us today\n20:08 - Yogi Raj uh really enjoying what we're going to pick up now where we left off but I do want to ask you uh C can I change horses Midstream Shadow Stevens and ask Yogi Raj are there\n20:20 - aliens yes there are aliens Those whom you think to be aliens are your very Luna ancestors who thousands of years before you went towards Celestial and higher\n20:36 - dimensions in Robes of light these people whom you think to be aliens are actually the sages of the fire Mist the great rishes the great luminaries like Abraham\n20:53 - and Moses and even more ancient would be Noah and Hermes and Enoch who are none other than your ancestors who have enlightened themselves totally and the Ancient of Days himself God the Creator\n21:10 - the whole evolving creation itself and these people whom in America you call aliens are the Flesh of your flesh the blood of your Blood The Sweat of your sweat and the light of your\n21:25 - souls they are here to guard your infant Humanity to ever more expanded spheres of self-realization I am not here talking about any doubtful things like UFOs\n21:41 - unidentified objects or all that I'm talking on a very clear-cut chapter a very vision of my own that people have seen the Christ they have seen Moses and they have seen chrishna these great\n21:54 - Masters thousands of people have seen them in Robes of light giving them vision and apparitions and please don't call them aliens they are the very light of your souls beautiful and they guide\n22:06 - the infant Humanity to higher states of divine realization I have a question for you when people are beaten down and in Despair and in disease staying positive\n22:21 - and having a happy optimistic hopeful attitude is really difficult and it's hard to make decisions of uh now I need to meditate now I need to apply myself they uh they're consumed or crippled by\n22:36 - their minds what do you what do you do in a in a case like that and as you come out of each gruelling bout all beaten and broken and scarred just have one more try it's dead\n22:51 - easy to die it's the keeping on living that's hard and that's what I tell my guys I said Don't Give Up Guys behind every cloud is the golden Rim a silver lining a golden Rim so if you persevere\n23:07 - and don't give up that is the Majesty of life that is the Valor that's what a man should be when he expresses himself in this determination nothing is really\n23:19 - impossible we must give the world this courage we must stand to together in courage in times of joy and in sorrow and can a person have abundance prosperity and still attain\n23:36 - freedom a person can have abundance and prosperity and still attain freedom but those who have attained freedom are so sick of their prosperity\n23:53 - and their abundance which they've had thousands of lives back that they discard this luggage and go as simple as the smile of a child through the eye of the needle towards Divine\n24:08 - realization that's why when Jesus said it's it's easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Gates of Heaven by this it didn't mean that you shouldn't\n24:18 - be rich you shouldn't have abundance you should but you should not be attached the key word is you should not be attached to that wealth but isn't it seductive what is the abundance and\n24:30 - wealth and having is it seems to be seductive that you have and then you feel like you need more and then I'll be happy if I have even more then that stage is not for Liberation because in\n24:43 - that stage you have you still have desires and for you to be totally liberated and get into Moka into pure salvation you should be desireless desireless and free burning\n24:55 - in Purity like a silent Divine fire yeah with still but still with appreciation for your abundance in your wealth you can appreciate your abundance in your wealth and the abundance and wealth of\n25:06 - the world why not but you shouldn't be attached to it if you have it one moment and a thief comes and takes it the next moment there shouldn't be any Ripple of thought in your mind's Lake it should\n25:17 - make no difference to you so you should be in a state of desirelessness the greatest abundance that a person can have is having that abundance he could be in a state of\n25:28 - Desire lessness like there was an American Saint here who was with parman yoganand his name was Luther Burbank he was a multi-millionaire and he donated all his estate and property you find\n25:39 - many Americans like this they get to that stage and they just feel like donating and they keep giving Bill Gates has done that in billions of dollars so you see when they go over the top\n25:50 - there's another emotion that comes in the human soul and psyche that's to give and seeing others happy happy they get a great thr oh yeah it's a huge thrill when you see little children in Africa\n26:02 - starving when you see their ribs disappearing when you see that they they have no teeth due to lack of calcium their teeth appearing in their mouth you've done such a job of course there\n26:13 - is a subtle ego in it but it's all basically humility and a joy of giving others so when you live for others and not yourself that's the time for you to be liberated I agree very good um uh how\n26:27 - would you describe the way the cosmos works the microcosm the macrocosm dimensions multiple Dimensions like 11 Dimensions or three or four or nine or how how do you put that in words or can\n26:41 - you you can put it in words but it's no use for you because what will you do even if you know it I mean God's running the cosmos we are little people here with our tin ticking Minds I mean it's a\n26:52 - huge phenomenal thing and it does happen it's given in Genesis I have written uh the autobiography of a self where I begin before the cosmos starts I have said boundless lay the\n27:07 - self existence in the truth of the self spread beyond Infinity from eternity to Eternity the self in his majesty did reain this is before creation and then\n27:21 - it begins with the the explosion of the nuclear subatom called the Great Sound the sound of Omar the light sound explosion this is how creation began in\n27:34 - our philosophy too and in the modern quantum physics and science has given the beginning of creation and the expansion of creation so the beginning of creation we call Brahma the first of\n27:49 - the Trinity the Creator called Brahma the creator meaning the expanding one then we have the second of the Trinity called Vishnu the all pervading one and after it is all pervading the\n28:04 - creation gets into the Big Crunch which we call Shiva the ultimate dissolution the dissolving of the whole of creation so this is the great Trinity of Brahma Vishnu Shiva of Father Son and\n28:20 - Holy Spirit [Music] M we have to take another another break and um we have many more questions we have yeah we have endless questions and\n28:30 - I'm sure that we'll find a way to get our way through all of this stuff and welcome back to the show that keeps your mind in mind uh I'm Shadow Stevens with good afternoon this is Dr freeze Yogi\n28:40 - Raj uh thank you for joining us this afternoon it's a pleasure to have you in our studio today and I we were um asked to make mention briefly of the experience uh that I had last night this\n28:52 - uh Shiva poot which in in which uh Yogi Raj um sits and has everyone um facing him and uh imparts this kind of conscious experience where you where I'm sitting on the floor and my body is achy\n29:10 - and everything is and he said I will clap my hand and impart this awareness and when he clapped my I wasn't disc uncomfortable anymore and you gaze at the face and hold it without blinking\n29:26 - and there was a shift that happened in the face of like morphing taking on different appearances of different like Moses and Jesus and and and so on I'm not making this\n29:39 - up can you expl this sounds like one of those things it's like a magic trick but I it's quite remarkable so Yogi Raj how can you please explain that how that happens and what what did he actually\n29:48 - see what transformation did Shadow experience you see what happens is that I give what what is called my soul consciousness of\n30:06 - a enlightened awareness so if the yogi is enlightened or if he's in a state of samadi he should be able to transfer his State his ex his Ecstasy of expanded\n30:21 - Consciousness to the disciples or to sincere Seekers or to an congregation who would like such an experience and what I give I will Define to you let's say I'm the Consciousness\n30:36 - and the disciples or The Seekers are the mind I Define it this way if any mind is attuned to an undifferentiated Consciousness that is of the master if any mind is attuned to an\n30:51 - undifferentiated Consciousness then that mind shall become that Consciousness to the Ree of its Attunement with that Consciousness and that's what happened when you\n31:03 - attuned to my state of samadi my no mind State my my state of knowingness the your thoughts disappeared you went into a thoughtless state of profound still mind\n31:16 - knowingness so what you went into a Shiva path is when the master takes the disciple into a thoughtless state of still mind knowingness or when the master takes the disciple into his\n31:30 - soulle consciousness of a thoughtless awareness this is what you experienced at the outset and this experience carried on shifting you to the no mind state of a knowing\n31:46 - awareness now when you went into the fourth and fifth D dimensions of the knowing awareness you started seeing changes in the aura around the body which are\n31:56 - subtler dimensions the aura always exists around every body in all human beings normal people have it small the Masters have it huge and big normal people have one or two colors or one\n32:09 - color Masters have five colors all the seven colors of the spectrum after you see the aura as your mind studies into a more heightened awareness you begin to see remembered\n32:25 - experiences of that Master past lives so if you see the face of Moses along with his face or morph to his face or the face of Shri yukteswar morph into the face of the this this master either\n32:42 - that Master has been a close associate of that great soul in his past life or the master has been in in this life a portion of that Soul called nman Kaya because the yogi great Masters like SRI\n32:59 - yukteswar Christ Krishna and Moses are able to produce more than one body and mind and work in two places or 10 places at the same time so Moses or Christ or Krishna Buddha yukteswar lahi mahasaya\n33:15 - the yogar can have 10 20 or 100 bodies and Minds identical to themselves working in different planes and different heavens and different phenomena at the same time this is what\n33:27 - was happening this this was a very Advanced lesson of EduCare of Education this is true EduCare means to bring in the light in Greek educar means bring in the light\n33:39 - and we brought in the light and everybody saw the light and the aura and that's why I took a feedback when 99% people see it the one who doesn't see it is the one one with a tense mind\n33:49 - therefore the feedback is taken it is given and to educate people into higher dimensions of their spiritual Essence the shaath shaktipat and pranat techniques are projected onto the\n34:04 - Audience by the living master and are you going to be able to do this on your webcast as well can people actually experience this if they tune in to the Agape\n34:16 - webcast oh yes we should mention that Friday uh webcast with Michael Beckwith um uh of agape and the debut of the DVD Wings of Freedom uh that's this Friday and that is where what is the is that at\n34:31 - the agapy website it's a the agapy Live premiere of wings to Freedom documentary of Yogi Raj's journey in the Himalayas towards his meeting with his spiritual Master known as Babaji that's how I\n34:43 - pronoun Babaji and that happens Friday August 12th at 700 p.m. now to watch online you just go to Agape live that's AG g a p lve Agape live.tv WIS one more time Agape live.tv\n34:60 - WIS and join in person Agape International spiritual center if you want to be there physically is just right the the address is 5700 uh Buckingham Parkway in Culver City okay\n35:10 - now after the screening Yogi Raj will share experiences of enlightened awareness with the crowd and the viewers and Dr Michael Beckwith will join Yogi Raj for a lively discussion of how to\n35:20 - apply ancient Yogi teachings to modern living which brings us up to 2012 and the transition we're going through The Awakening uh can you uh elaborate a bit about about\n35:34 - 2012 well 2012 according to me is not the end of the world as the Mayans suppose it is according to that their calendar they say that the world ends or it comes to\n35:48 - an end or there'll be great catastrophes which no doubt there will be but according to me this is the end of one cycle and the beginning of a new cycle\n35:59 - which is a positive thing it's a positive thing it's a mixed bag with catastrophes holocausts and the changing of the Gods of the great Masters the great spiritual\n36:14 - leaders 5,000 years ago 3,12 before Christ a great phenomena a Divine being appeared called Lord Krishna 2012 will complete this 5,000 year old\n36:33 - cycle this Lord Krishna or Christ will have his second coming the second Advent from 2012 Christ is variously the second Advent is known as the coming of the Ki\n36:51 - avar The Coming of the mitria Buddha and the second Advent of Christ and what does that mean this is all the same thing of the coming of this great being the question asked is whether he\n37:05 - will come in person my answer is that his Spirit shall pervade humanity and take them to higher levels of consciousness and self-realization this period will be\n37:18 - beginning of the changing of the God where symbolically the four horsemen will come on their four horses to change the God the first will be the ancient world\n37:35 - teacher who is called the mria Krishna or the Ki avar whom we know in the Christian world as the second Advent of Christ he is now the present World\n37:49 - teacher the true spiritual World teacher is the Christ variously known as the K avar and the mitria Buddha he will hand over the Reigns to his successor to no less a person than the\n38:04 - yogar L mahasaya of the cria yog systems of the self-realization fellowship who was mentioned in autobiography of a yogi so yog ofar the Divine being will be the next\n38:21 - successor and World teacher for the future cycle but that's a Consciousness um yes not a person like a leader the person can it is very easy from them to\n38:34 - materialize from a Consciousness to a living being in form by hosting a body tell me you can how does that they could host a body they could materialize the body I just finish this thought then the\n38:46 - other person who is the ideal King the ideal teacher always is accompanied by the ideal King now the ideal King will be none other than than the Lord vwat Manu who is variously called Enoch or\n39:05 - mized so this Lord vasat Manu the ruler of the past root race the seventh root race will hand it over to the next Manu the next king the ideal King who is none other than the yo the the ganar SRI\n39:22 - yukteswar of autobiography of a yogi the guru of parmanu yoganand so the successors of Lord vashar Manu and mria will be SRI yukteswar as the world\n39:37 - King and lii mahasaya as the world teacher the four horses that they ride the mitria Krishna or the second ad Advent of Christ shall be riding on a\n39:49 - white horse Enoch or the Lord vashar Manu shall be riding on the brown horse the successor of the world teacher that is the Christ is lahi mahasaya who will\n40:04 - be riding on the light pale brown and yellow horse and the successor of Enoch or vwat manu who is Shri yukteswar will be riding on the black horse now these four horses of the\n40:20 - apocalypse which is mentioned in the Bible are representing the four major root races of this world which which shall be looked after and evolved into the perfect race 700 years from\n40:33 - 2012 that was going to be my question so from the time of 2012 you're saying a 7-year period 700 years oh so this is not something that I have to personally be looking forward to which is which is\n40:47 - which is we cannot have the personal ego here it's a whole world disciple on the move it's a world movement and you will have died many times and been born before you come into the First new race\n40:57 - it is you who are the actual SE sixth subrace or the sixth sub civilization who will become the seventh root the sixth root civilization 700 years ago in the in the in the place of California\n41:15 - where the new race will be born where I'm talking to you now here you will be 700 years hence as the perfect race of the Buddhas the aaric race or the race of the siddhas the perfect Humanity will\n41:26 - be born here the ution starts from 2012 but now in between the physical manifestations of the Christ or the vwat Manu or the Moses who is Sri yukteswar and the Abraham who\n41:40 - is lahari mahasiah these physical operations can appear and bless individuals all around the world but it is their choice and there nobody can dictate to them and no\n41:53 - fortune teller can say this as to they will come at such and such a Time but if you pray for them if you meditate with an open heart with humility you shall have Their Blessings with and without\n42:04 - form their Spirit shall pervade the whole of the human race from 2012 to 2700 where you will be born again as the perfect Humanity clo clar audience all the powers all the\n42:18 - siddhis no telephones only telepathy all clairo so you will be the it's you will it be us the same people you are the same people yes you will be evolving your souls you are destined to be the\n42:32 -

the stomach but this is all done by Masters you know in the thing called The Dream Weaver where the fabric of their karma is woven with shreds of light and DNA and those shreds are taken the\n44:18 -

          "transcript": "00:06 - an [Music] man Yogi [Music] I bow to the indwelling spirit of\n00:46 - humanity can you please lessen the volume please I will first begin by telling you what is yog people want to know in simple terms what is\n01:05 - yog yog in a short words is the union of the individual Consciousness with the universal Consciousness\n01:23 - yog is the union of Jiva with Shiva the universal consciousness the third definition of yog it is an inner Ascent yog is an inner\n01:46 - Ascent through ever more refined and ever more expanded spheres of Consciousness through ever more expanded spares of mind and\n02:02 - Consciousness to get to the Consciousness God Essence that lies at the core of your own being so it's an inner Journey how do we\n02:18 - know that we are making progress on the path or we are a master of yog panjali has put it with one stroke of his Spen and I tell you for everyone to\n02:37 - understand it's simple how do we know we are enlightened how do we know we have got M it says freedom from mind is MOA you tell me is it so\n02:54 - simple I tell you try to free yourself from your mind try to be still and have no thought crossing your mind's eye and you will see it is impossible it takes years and years and lifetimes and\n03:08 - lifetimes to conquer your mind and he who is the Conqueror of his own mind is the Conqueror of the universe this is a fact which is true yog is an inner asent through ever more\n03:34 - refined and ever more expanded spheres of Consciousness and mind to get to the goddess goddesses that lies at the core of your own being now I will get on to talking about\n03:50 - yog and Kaa yog which we practice and the benefits thereof but we as the organization as an existing reality on Earth we have a certain Soul\n04:08 - cry and this Soul cry binds us as one being and my soul cry which I had already requested when I went to the United Nations I said put this up on your meditation\n04:22 - Hall I was not able to do it but this is the soul cry Humanity are uniting Rel religion breath are uniting prayer and\n04:36 - Consciousness are uniting God nobody has any objections to that so this religion socalled covers the whole globe and is really fit for people to inwardly digest and live\n04:53 - by then we have a mission statement we are known as the hamsas the K yog tradition my organization is called the sidat yog parara the members of it are called the\n05:09 - hamsas the swans so we called the hamsa parar the swan family Universal Swan family so the first mission statement is we the hamsas ham is a symbol of the Soul we the hamers are meditated to the\n05:26 - furthering of human awareness this is the work of all of us we should meditate to the furthering of human awareness awareness is divine Consciousness which is the religion it's\n05:40 - not Hindu Christian Islam Muslim 70 aders none of those sectarian things it is humanity and Consciousness we the Hamas are meditated to the furthering of human\n05:55 - awareness we the Hamas are dedicated to New Life Awakening this is the third one for Earth peace healing through self- peace\n06:12 - healing that is healing and we the hamsas are dedicated to serving Humanity as our larger self so these are the principles and ideals We Stand by I'd like you to know this because if you\n06:27 - know this it's easier for you to join such a vast uh uh humanitarian movement which is for the whole of humanity we pray for the love and peace and spiritual evolution of the whole of\n06:44 - humanity now getting to the science of Kaa yog Kaa yog and Raj yog are intimately Linked In the sutras of pangali one of the chapters is on Kaa\n06:59 - yog there's there's a big section on K yog and what does k yog consist of Kay yog consists of three basic principles which are called\n07:15 - tapa which means self-directed austerities swad self-directed studies of the superconscious states of your mind that\n07:32 - is swad self-conscious study with your own effort and the third is factor of K yog is iswar pradan that means total surrender of\n07:46 - yourself to God and His Divine representative the sguru these are the three factors so when you go to tapa they self-directed disciplines you get up in\n08:04 - the morning you discipline yourself you keep your timings you keep a proper diet you meditate at the correct time eat at the correct time sleep at the correct time and do yoga it's all done in a\n08:16 - sequence to tame and tune your mind to be more sensitive to the higher faculties of Nature and soon you become more and more refined\n08:30 - so tapa there is Yum ASAS various bodily postures to strengthen your spine to give an energy boost to the\n08:43 - Kundalini these are all very important factors then comes the mental aspect of it swad s ad s means self ad means study of the self so we start with studying our mind and then the when the Mind\n08:59 - purifies it merges into Consciousness and we we cannot study Consciousness then we start experiencing the subtler and subtler states of Consciousness this is what the study of\n09:12 - yog is composed of swad self study and then when you reach higher and higher states of Union of the individual\n09:26 - soul with the universal Spirit the individual Consciousness and the universal cons Cosmic Consciousness then what is there to do there is something you can do\n09:39 - Surrender At Last the feeling of I amness and iess the ego surrender it to the Supreme and merge in the Divine Cosmic essence of reality that is called iswar pridan total surrender to God and\n09:59 - His represent atives and it's only when you let go your ego it's difficult to let go the ego you cling on you cling to your body you cling to your senses you cling to\n10:10 - your desires you cling to name you cling to fame when you let all of these go the good Lord the reality of creation comes to you and he is for your limited mind totally and absolutely Beyond\n10:26 - Comprehension like a huge void a huge infinite Eternal awareness and he will satisfy all your little fragmented space time events and desires for underlying the fragmented\n10:46 - space time Desires and events of creation the underlying ocean of reality is existing forever and ever and that is parent Source when we get over this froth and Bubbles of this worldly\n11:05 - existence we go to the one reality where there there is neither fro nor bubbles but there is the real we do not know whether there is God we do not know whether there is not God\n11:20 - or whether there is God so what I propose to present before you that there is certainly one reality permeating the whole of creation\n11:35 - and Beyond creation who overlooks creation so I call it reality you can call it God or Allah or ishwar these are questions of mere\n11:52 - dialect the essential fact is that there is a reality which we can comprehend in fragmented spaces in day-to-day life and which is also beyond our comprehension\n12:11 - that is the reality which frees us gives us total freedom from the pain and sorrow and death and disease of this world and if one person can achieve it all of you can achieve it there's hope\n12:26 - for you all I guarantee your progress for I am there for you as the presence those who are prepared to get initiated from this humble servant of\n12:46 - humanity I vouch that whether you are in South Africa or North America or Australia or in the bambuda Triangle I will be there with you when you practice the Crea breath and you say gurunath\n13:00 - come to me I will come in your breath and you will find your breath is lengthening all the people here have vouched for this they have experienced it not once but 100 times and so also\n13:11 - will you experience me I am the servant of humanity and I am there for you as the presence I am there not physically but my spiritual Essence will be with you if\n13:25 - you are initiated this is the service I offer to mankind now on this path the cria yog process has definite\n13:40 - techniques you have to do the whole sequence of this package of Kaa yog it's very very scientific why people get struck on the path some commit suicide some leave meditation and some because\n13:52 - they haven't been given the whole process it's not scientific so the whole Rim the whole circle has to be done the process is first we\n14:03 - begin with Omar that is the birthing hum of [Music] creation this is the sound of creation the sound of the Divine mother when\n14:19 - she's giving birth to the countless galaxies and stars and quers in her Eternal dance and and as she dances she spins around the whole universe in a glorious\n14:34 - dance and what is the girth what is the limit of the circumference of her dance what is the limit of the outer borders of her skirt 14.7 billion years 14.7 billion\n14:49 - years in light years so therefore this is the vastness of creation our whole creation is 14.7 billion years ago the sun is 8 billion\n15:00 - approximately years old and the Earth is but a child 4 billion years old so all these things are very necessary to understand Humanity first got its spark of Devotion to God at the\n15:17 - human level when the first Nursery of adepts was formed on this planet Earth when the Great Lords of flame came in their Chariots of Fire when the Great Lords of flame came in\n15:31 - their maraba they they talk about maraba they don't know what it is statute of fire 11 million years ago and the head of\n15:44 - this was the being called Shiva goraka babaii he established this Nursery of adepts this hierarchy of adepts 11 million years ago and the spark of devotion meditation and intuition was\n16:08 - added to the normal evolving human mind it got an extra spark of intuition with which it could connect in this Jacob's Ladder physical body emotional body mental\n16:23 - body and last of all the intuitional body and then the spirit intuitional bodies like the making of the Soul they could contact for these there were various techniques given by K yog and\n16:36 - Raj yog the Lord panjali and shiv goraka babaj gave techniques of Kaa yog very simply they were the first we start with the Omar technique the birthing har of creation the second technique is the\n16:50 - vital breath it's called the Kaa yog The PR upon yna the sacred pran upon fire ceremony where you offer the exhaled into the inhaled breath and the inhaled into the\n17:04 - exhaled breath and Lord Krishna tells Arjun he Arjun fear not he who practiced the scientific breath the spiritual breath of K yog shall not die in vain he shall lose the effects of his past Bad\n17:19 - Karma and become a high sold being and gorak tells B this High soul shall attain to me he shall attain to\n17:32 - Divine eternity this is the promise given by all the masters of the past whether it is Krishna whether shiv goraka babaj whether it is Christ they have given this science to souls on this\n17:47 - Earth so that they can evolve from man The Brute to man the man to man the god you have seen in our present World situation you have seen political and emotional and mental\n18:00 - upheavals where man behaves like a brute have you seen man behaving like a brute cruy so in our Humanity there is man The Brute and Men Behaving like men Civil Society cooperating with one another\n18:14 - helping one another living in harmony you've seen societies like that also right and you have seen great Souls who give up their life for others so That Others May Live and who are constantly\n18:24 - in meditation always asking for the welfare the progress and the love of human you've seen people like this also so there's such a vast difference in the psychophysiological\n18:37 - and the mental uh expression of The Human Condition and yog tends to correct this and lessen the Gap y gives you\n18:51 - techniques whereby you can lose your ego get more courage sacrifice your time and and and your your energy for the benefit of others right so these are the techniques\n19:06 - the first is the Omar Kaa then is the prapan Y the breathing technique which we do known as the Shiva Shakti anusandhan this breathing technique is known\n19:18 - as the yoga pranayam the Kaa yog The Shiva Shak anandhan the pran Y it has these various names it's a very ancient technique from the Himalayas and the great\n19:33 - Masters the third technique which will be taught to you in Kaa yog will be an exercise called the mahamudra the great the posture of the great Liberation as you stretch forward\n19:50 - from side to side you open the vertebrae this the pale vertebral when you open and stretch it the the conscious energy the Consciousness in you enters in a\n20:08 - purified State and moves up to the brain cells vivifies them and then moves down and then moves up to six Cosmic Meridian points called the plexus they are also called the six lotuses of the seven\n20:25 - Heavens existing within man they're also called the chakras in America they can't pronounce chakras so they say shakras right is that the correct pron\n20:38 - chakras the pronic lotuses so this is the second the third process is the mahamudra where you extend your spine and enable the Consciousness to merge\n20:55 - into the superconscious state in the third stage the energy lies at the bottom of the spine where the burning fires of creativity and evolution exist which are\n21:11 - not revealed to B unless they open it the magic mother should come and the process should be there the guru's grace to liberate Cinderella from The Embers at the base of the spine cind\n21:27 - is at the base of the spine that is the Kundalini and when Kundalini is blown by the breath of K and is fan she blazes and awakens and gushes up the chimney of\n21:38 - the spine dressed in her glorious form to meet her Lord her prince charming at sahr so that the Shakti the feminine energy meets shivba at s and that process you are liberated you are free\n21:53 - and one with the Lord Glory H Allelujah then we go on to the other technique after mahamudra you go on to other mudras we have to get rid of various\n22:15 - factors first we have to get rid of the fear of death and overcome death the fear of death is got rid of by the grace of the master the sadguru and by practicing Kaa focusing on the root\n22:32 - chakra at the bottom of the spine gradually by practicing this Divine breath you overcome the fear of death and ultimately dear death itself the next obstacle which you have\n22:46 - to overcome in Kaa while practicing Kaa is the duality of desires love and hate joy and sorrow which keep your mind and oscillation so if the lake of your\n23:01 - mind is always has the waves of love and hate joy and sorrow can you see the moon of your Delight in the ripples of your mind's Lake you have to stop the ripples of your mind's Lake to behold the moon\n23:11 - of your delight and to do that the practice of Kaa yog nabria is very very essential that is the next technique they're very scientific techniques that's why I'm explaining what each\n23:24 - technique does after overcoming all frivolous desires love hate wanting of material things you grow out of it and they hold no interest for you because you are searching for\n23:39 - the Eternal what is that what are we searching for in yoga what is the answer the yogi ask what is you you ask I'm fed up of all this barari and this and\n23:49 - boyfriend and girlfriend and joy and sorrow and this thing and I tell me God or tell me you ask the yogi what is it by achieving which I can achieve\n24:06 - all what is that the answer comes God is that by achieving whom you can achieve all what is that by which all my desires will be fulfilled that one and only the Lord God\n24:24 - is that your inner reality is that by achieving and realizing which all your desires will be fulfilled I'm satisfied let's get on let's move on go on to the\n24:35 - goal come to me and get empowered and init initiated I will be there for you and lead you along the path step by step as I'm doing this very moment explaining you all the techniques step by step and\n24:49 - leading you on to the science of Kaa as I speak I am steing your mind I'm already transforming you removing the pains in your body and stealing your mind let go open the\n25:01 - heart so after the naboka the desires the hatreds all dissolved then you come to the Heart Center where you have a technique in yoga where the ego is dissolved so the ego you slay the\n25:15 - dragon of the ego the dragon of the ego have you seen the picture of St George there are three equivalents in the dragon of the ego they're all dragon\n25:29 - Slayers Dragon Slayers means slaying all the desires and the feeling that I am the doer of these things you are not the doer when you have the feeling that you are just a conduit just a a channel and\n25:45 - the glory of the Lord flows through you not saying it mentally but realizing it then your ego is dissolved so you slay the dragon of the ego to get rid of that feeling of me and\n25:57 - mine because the ego is the greatest obstacle which which Blocks Your individual Consciousness from merging with the universal Consciousness the ego stands like a big wall between your\n26:10 - individual Consciousness and the Lord Universal Consciousness so that is a technique then you have the third wall which\n26:26 - comes the individual ego dissolved then your entry to the final state where you have to dissolve that final ego the cosmic ego where you realize all of this is me\n26:41 - that is done at the last state it is done in the state of samadi called the dharm samadhi I hope I have given you a very succinct and explicit explanation of what is kria yog\n26:54 - what is Raj yog what is your goal what you have to do your so World cry your mission statement the techniques you have to practice all is laid before you now it is your choice I am there for you\n27:07 - as the presence the more you depend on me the more you depend on gurunath the more you depend on me the more dependable I become to you om namash now I will take question answers\n27:27 - from the people whatever questions there are you must let me know just give me an idea of how much time has elapsed since I spoke 20 minutes 25 minutes or something or 15 minutes or\n27:40 - what how much time has elapsed since I started uh 10 minutes I think that's more than enough if I give them more they'll get indigestion it was a very compacted uh\n27:53 - uh Speech we have some lovely questions from the YouTube audience yes questions from the YouTube audience yes I would also invite questions from the in-person audience who is in front of me so do it\n28:05 - your way so the first question uh from one of your subscribers named Andria radika she asks gurunath how can we tell true gurus from false gurus what are the signs of a\n28:19 - true avaric being and how can we be sure there are no evil demonic forces at play so she's asked three questions in one yes she has asked how can we tell true gurus from past who's this\n28:32 - person her name is what's the name her name is Andrea radika andrija radika radika I heard I didn't hear the first name andrija or andrion yeah andrija Andria radika from\n28:51 - where I don't know from where okay maybe from SP tener from Spain okay anyway so the first question is she has asked it's a he I'm sorry not\n29:06 - a she okay it doesn't matter the soul has no gender before me I see sitting a Divine Soul sparkling with the Lord I don't see any male or female there's no difference we always see the soul of a\n29:21 - person and not his outer garment that is just a vesture yes so how do we recognize a true Master\n29:33 - then so how can we uh tell a true Guru from a false Guru what are the signs of a true aaric being and how can we be sure there are no evil demonic forces no no SL we\n29:45 - have to go slow deep because I have to hear there's a distance how can we tell a true Guru from a past Guru false Guru and second is what are the signs of a true aoic being aoic being and then how\n29:58 - can we be sure there are no evil demonic forces at play how can we be sure that there are no evil demonic forces at play how can we be sure that there are no evil demonic forces where at like\n30:12 - from The Guru from the person that they're seeing from the guru that which they're watching that they don't know how can we they feel that the guru might be a demon in Disguise of a good Guru\n30:21 - that's what you saying yes and that's a Karma or his karma now first she has asked a question how can we realize a true Master a true\n30:37 - Master whoever he may be I advise you go to all the people and the Masters in the world but there are certain litmus tests of the true master there are certain litmus\n31:04 - tests the first test of a true Master is then when you come in the presence of a true master and he sits before you your mind\n31:20 - Stills it's totally focused toward him you're hearing him and all your other errands or jobs or work they seem to be very tinsel and frivolous and the gravitas of his speech\n31:35 - conquers your heart and makes you feel that this is the most important knowledge that you are drinking at the present moment and your mind is not scattered it's totally focused on the\n31:47 - master that is the first time the sign that you are listening to a true Master secondly there will be the and the energy there's a constant flow of\n32:02 - transmission from the true Master some feel it more some feel it less according to their receptivity but all feel it there's a constant transmission and then to the more\n32:16 - advanced view you feel ah this is it I have reached home I couldn't want better and then as you practice\n32:29 - the third thing when he gives you the experience you feel I have quenched The Thirst of the ages I have reached home so when during your association with that Guru Master if you feel these\n32:42 - things then that is a true master I don't Fe a true Guru and a master about false gurus and false Masters I do not want to speak because there are none because they are not\n32:60 - Masters if you don't feel the sign of Stillness of mind the true Master can still your mind at anym with a wave of his hand your every thought will be scattered out that is the bind that is\n33:11 - the thing of a true Master he should have conquered his mind and got Mo but how do you know he has conquered his mind with a wave of his hand he can conquer your mind too although you have\n33:23 - not conquered it sitting in his presence when you associate with him you will also become still the sign of a true Master is this listen carefully you are the\n33:36 - disciple and I will call you mind for all practical purposes okay I am the sguru I will call myself Consciousness right listen to my equation my principle\n33:53 - the law when I say mind it means you this is the sign of a true Master a sadguru sadguru is referred to as undifferentiated Consciousness\n34:10 - okay you are referred to as mind if any mind is attuned to an undifferentiated even Consciousness then that mind shall\n34:26 - become that consciousness of Stillness to the degree of its Attunement with that Consciousness if any mind is attuned to an undifferentiated Consciousness then\n34:39 - that mind shall become that Consciousness to the degree of its Attunement with that Consciousness this is as great a maxim or\n34:53 - formula or Principle as any except this is made in the spiritual realm aredes made it in the in the realm of matter then there were other equations this is a this is a phenomena of its own anybody\n35:07 - want to ask any questions have you understood and that's what's happening some of you are totally gone because you're totally surrendered some of you are totally and there's little\n35:17 - disturbance so you're not so totally that's happening now it's happening now to your eye who all is getting the still mind raise your hands and look around the people in the front look around the\n35:29 - new bees look around look back your mind will become still there will be no thought like you know I have to do this I have to run you're totally focused on the master and there you\n35:43 - are G yes there's another question from YouTube are we still carrying on on the public uh this thing the yes yes uh Miss scha Sharma asks gurunath pranam sha\n35:59 - sharmaa Sharma okay whenever I need you I just call you in my heart and I can feel your presence immediately does this mean I am being accepted as your disciple and you will be with me\n36:15 - forever so did you hear it I will repeat it there's a disciple calleda Sharma she says gurunath whenever I'm in need or whenever I call you I can feel your presence in my heart she\n36:32 - didn't say whether she feels it as the breath or a lightness or an energy transmission she feels and then she says does this mean that you have accepted me as your disciple so it obviously does\n36:45 - because if the master has initiated her and he goes thousands of miles and he transmits his energy is definitely that he's there for her as the presence the answer is yes\n36:60 - and so all of you who receive it you are disciples to the degree that you are at one minute with me if a person looks at me and goes straight into samadhi you're totally one\n37:10 - Sam if someone listens and is engrossed but still looking at at the dog they have died outside their pet dog is there or they still uh wanting to get their bottle of water and that's a distracted\n37:22 - mind they're not totally focused but if you're totally focused you're at one the subject and the object become one you forget yourself when you forget that you're sitting there and you're totally\n37:34 - engrossed to your master that's it you have become one perfect concentration Sam yes next question one more from YouTube Mr uh\n37:49 - Michael bone who is a longtime uh disciple he asks uh how to withstand the Heat and purification effect of Kaa yoga when difficult karmas come on strong yeah it says how to\n38:07 - expand how to withstand how to withand the Heat and purification effect of Kaa yog how to withstand difficult karma when they come on strong corre after that that's the question that the\n38:23 - purification effect of Kaa yoga which brings upon purification effect of the Kaa yog which purification is he talking about the purification that comes as a\n38:35 - result of Kaa yog which causes difficult karmas to come on strong for him so this is a two-way phenomena when you practice Kaa yog your negative karmas are wiped out very fast and the\n38:54 - sting in the pain of that karma is taken by the guru like you have bad karma you're going to undergo a car accident and you've been practicing K and you have faith in your\n39:06 - master master I'm surrendered protect me you're doing it and you're doing k for 6 months and you undergo an accident where you're this thing the accident will\n39:23 - happen your leg which was to break will not break it will be sprained so Kaa will lessen the impact of your Bad Karma which is to happen it may not totally eradicate it but it'll lessen\n39:37 - the impact of your negative Karma and if it is a death thing it is high command many people have been saved from Death itself there are three or four cases I know people sincere\n39:49 - practicers they have been saved from Death that is the power of the sadguru babaii they all all how many people here in the inperson are new they've come the first time\n40:05 - raise your hands the new people yes yeah so it's good to get a response from the new people because I'm giving you something totally different which other gurus don't give like breathing\n40:16 - through your breath or you feeling the transmission you're feeling very peaceful and calm and if you pay attention suddenly your spine will start getting straight the pain in your\n40:28 - shoulders or back will be eased out just by sitting in the presence of the master all will happen provided you are in tune with me tune means same wavelength\n40:44 - CPS cycles per second alpha beta theta so if I'm I'm sending a vibrations at Theta then you should be at Theta right then you will get the maximum effect so this is the answer to this\n41:07 - question to worry not keep practicing your Kaa if you if you just start newly and the karma is coming upon you then you have to bear that\n41:18 - Karma but it can mitigate the ill effects of what is to befall you in future and that depends on the intensity of your practice how much you can avoid that bad negativity normally people go\n41:33 - through it bravely you have to be brave but don't leave the cria keep practicing it be brave sincerely practice it\n41:48 - yes can we take any questions from here from the live audience can't hear can we take questions from the hall questions from people in person we not the no mind is so strong could\n42:14 - you take away the burning in our eyes when we're focused on you translate through the mic louder the no mind is so strong that it's making what is so strong the no mind\n42:29 - in Alliance my no mind transmission is so strong it's causing burning in your eyes Okay so I will take away the burning of your eyes keep your eyes open and look\n42:44 - at me all of you look at me all your burning will go if you have it are you ready okay now is the burning gone is your burning lesson to gone yes\n43:04 - how many else had burning and it's gone is the burning gone okay just with the wave of the hand he's using the life force energy the pric energy this is also a sign of a\n43:16 - master that he will do this so he has to be able to give shath Shakti paath and prath Shakti paath is the transmission of energy to evolve your kini to awaken it prath is breathing through your\n43:32 - breath I can give some time and shath is making you one giving you an experience of my state of mind my state of consciousness transforming your mind to my Consciousness that is what is the\n43:46 - litmus test that's the Lynch pin of the master has reached Enlightenment where he can not only steal his own mind but he can steal the mind of the disciples and implant in in their mind instead his\n43:60 - Consciousness which is their Consciousness because we are one at the level of Consciousness humanity is one the question uh comes comes from the zoom audience the at Manar the Kaa yog\n44:20 - empowerment they ask what can be practiced this is from Aman prit doad amand do am what can be practiced in daily life to\n44:35 - increase surrender and to increase awareness consciously apart from the practice of Kaa yog yeah okay I I read the sentence but the Cru what can be\n44:51 - factored what can we do to increase in our daily life no read like this what can we do continue in our daily life yes what can we do in our daily life to increase surrender or submission to the\n45:13 - guru and conscious awareness apart from the practice of Kaa yog so what can we do in our daily life to\n45:30 - reduce the ego the arrogance is he wants to reduce the ego and the arrogance the humility be humble to all the people all around you K yog was in any case\n45:42 - reducing your ego he want to reduce the ego right did he use the word ego or did he use the word humility Dan he said surrender how can we the what does he\n45:52 - want to reduce so if he if he wants to have surrender to the guru practice the K yog with diligence all those techniques will make you surrender to\n46:07 - the guru there you don't have to surrender to this s Guru because he's already in your breath wherever you may be in the world he will be breathing along with\n46:18 - your breath and you will experience this firsthand I had a question um when in on car when we you see our system here is very bad the system of transmission or hearing me\n46:45 - can everybody hear me but the system of the the noise the the S question coming to me is we must improve that digitally either put up a mic or an amplifier or something because every question I\n46:58 - cannot hear and that gives me unnecessary strain to my brain whereas the questions are no questions I I'm already solving your question yes so in\n47:13 - Omar we strike the chakra and it starts as a a point strike and then it spreads it spreads and then it envelops the chakra that's kind of like\n47:30 - concentration meditation samade so it's like this it's a very complex question and I need to hear every word clearly you have to come right up here and tell me you're talking about the technique\n47:45 - itself uh so could you please sir take the effort to trouble to stand up and come 10 to 12 steps near to me I will not harm anyone I will just trans I'm transmitting love so so dear\n48:04 - Dan you can step up four or five steps yes yes should should I just shout um yeah you can just yeah so in Omar we strike the chakra in Omar Kaa we strike the chakra with we're telling a\n48:22 - technique to to the open house remember Dan is this a proper question k to tell this question to an open house the actual technique of Omar then we can close the open house\n48:34 - close it okay okay CH yes no no let him let him ask let him ask they will not know it okay so the the chakra is struck with M yes struck\n48:49 - with a sound and it's like a a pebble dropping into a pond okay and then it spreads it spreads and then it envelops the whole Pond it envelops the whole Pond the whole Lotus so it's like it's\n49:04 - like starting with concentration the spread is like meditation and then the enveloping is like Sade so then it's like suum because you\n49:16 - have concentration meditation and samade so wouldn't that be Sam so that would do Sam you can do samam in every om car it depends upon the degree of concentration applied The Faculty of\n49:31 - exclusive attention in every chakra when you chant you that is you the chant and the lotus in which you strike the Omar be one om that means you are the sound you the sound and The\n49:53 - Petal are one that that is dy Andy of that the see the seeing and the scene all become one so that you have accomplished that to the fullest degree\n50:12 - in every Center in all the seven Heavens I was very curious like in India we have a name for the seven Heavens om m [Music]\n50:43 - [Music] so also in the Islamic tradition or Christianity do you have the names of the seven Heavens or they just say they are seven Heavens have they given the\n50:53 - names no they have not given they've just said it's a heaven seven Heavens or Z so that's your answer sir you can do a degree of concentration applied bind\n51:06 - your mind to the sound bind your mind to the sound we have a question from David vline are the people here the new people who have come are you able to understand\n51:20 - what I've said so far have you been able to understand it's not difficult is it you didn't understand or little you understood you understood a lot yeah you\n51:34 - look wise this side you guys you understood okay guno since we have many new people here in the auditorium as well as online could you talk about the benefits of the\n51:52 - Crea yoga practice on one hand the components of it you know pram and Mantra and concentration which have uh undeniable physical benefits but can you also comment on the spiritual\n52:09 - benefits I'm sorry I I cannot uh understand if if you can speak without the mic also I can write up here you you'll have to in future improve the system of the\n52:21 - mic gath since we have many new people sof if you hold it a little away yeah since we have many new people here tonight uh what since I what since we have many new people I have many new\n52:36 - people right here tonight here tonight online and in in your presence here in my presence online right could you talk about the benefits of the Kaa yoga practice when you look at the components\n52:54 - of it with pranam and Mantra and concentration there are obvious physical benefits from the practice but can you also comment on the spiritual benefits of the\n53:09 - practice okay so according to me I have spoken about the spiritual benefits of the practice that it goes through various layers here are the spiritual practices of the\n53:24 - benefits of Kaa yog that as you practice the breath at the bottom of the K yog at the bottom of your spine sits the little Divinity and she is the power of the\n53:40 - Universe She is called Kundalini and she's sitting by the Embers of the fire of the bottom of the spine she is called Cinderella the lady of the ashes the\n53:54 - lady of the Cinders and when you do W she when you do the Kaa yog you're Fanning the Embers and you make her rise the Kundalini she Rises through the chimney of the spine Rising through\n54:09 - every chakra the seven Heavens to meet her Lord at sahastra so Shiva has Consciousness here so with her she takes her own awareness in her womb which is our Consciousness which is we as Souls\n54:26 - so she engulfs us each individual soul of ours and takes the mother takes in her womb the soul our souls and merges it into the Father which is Shiva this I have given most beautifully and\n54:42 - graphically the benefits of K yog are holistic I mean for the the body we do the yoga in K yog we do the mahamudra stretching the spine The Secret Of Youth is a flexible spine\n55:01 - so we do this the the mahamudra and other ass then the pranayam is known as the fire ceremony of the yogi it burns all past evil karmas Krishna has told Arjun\n55:15 - of the benefits of K yog oh Arjun he who offers the exhaled into the inhaled breath and the inhaled into the exhaled breath shall Lo lose the effects of his past Bad Karma and negativity he shall\n55:32 - become an high so being he shall attain to me so this is what more benefit do you want than to become the Christ himself this is a tremendous benefit of K yog and so does gorak tell\n55:53 - uh binat how many understood raise your hands at least five yes so this means he who gets lost in samadhi in the in the practice of the K yog samadhi in parasta\n56:29 - he who gets lost in the goddess ofast he becomes Immortal from second to Second neither the past nor the future can harass him or kill him or degrade or disintegrate him for he is one in the\n56:57 - bosom of the Lord he is INS sconed in the center of Consciousness and he becomes he becomes drunk he becomes drunk in the Divinity of his own\n57:15 - being so do you know what is that he becomes drunk in the Divine Divinity of his own being so this is the benefits of K yog there can be no\n57:29 - benefits there's Popular Science there's mechanics there's politics there's all these economic subjects but if there is no proper healthy man to run politics and economics and the Run the World then\n57:43 - what is the use of all these subjects and all these techniques if the man is not present if he's daughtering or he's got Alzheimer's he cannot run the the whole situation so yoga is a practice\n57:56 - which which keeps you fit so that you can enjoy life and progress in life and have God and Mammon together you can have both but you must be constant in your Crea practice and\n58:11 - you must start not at this age I'm 80 now but because I started at 20 I'm able to walk I'm fit I'm able to swim so you must start the Kaa practice with your exercise at a young age the this is very\n58:27 - important so this is the the the practice the Practical practice of your keeping healthy body is a benefit of Kaa yog having a good diet is a benefit accured from Kaa yog is prescribed diets\n58:42 - and healthy exercises like mahamudra and then you have devotional songs like bajans they keep you in a balanced State and then you have the cleansing of the Mind\n58:55 - techniques of K like the Omar K the NAU then theal sh that is the the penetration of the brah Vishnu\n59:14 - grti and the rudra grti in the Brahma grti the benefits of Kaa and NAA that you can conquer the fear of death in the Vish\n59:26 - then is the benefits of it is that you can conquer your ego which is the greatest obstacle between the individual and the cosmic Consciousness they're huge these\n59:38 - benefits are huge they're stupendous you cannot even comprehend them as they talking to you but you must set your shoulder to the wheel practice practice practice it's a key of\n59:53 - success so this dissolves the ego and this the final final veil of Illusion delusion and error the rudra which is the shanetra that unveils the Edge of\n01:00:06 - Time and the final space time continuum which is the web of delusion which separates the enlightened being from the supreme god Ence even the enlightened\n01:00:21 - being is not finally enlightened he's enlightened to that state of the PR merger in the whole of creation when that Veil when you unveil that from your mind's\n01:00:34 - eye because that state before the unveiling is like a clean mirror you can see your image and the image of God through a clean mirror of divine mind but when you break the\n01:00:48 - mirror itself the mirror of the Divine mind behind that is the Eternal spotless Sky of divine consciousness so even a person who sees his own Divine image and divine mind in the saal samadi\n01:01:04 - is enlightened in Divine mind but the ultimate Enlightenment is when you break the mirror of the mind and take out all Reflections and go into the Divine Consciousness that is the final State\n01:01:17 - and that state K yoke takes you up to it is not K yog that is a state of Raj yog and they are linked these are the benefits of K yog what can I say about the benefits of K yog what does k yog\n01:01:34 - give you in one word I can describe the benefits what are the benefits of K yog God is there anything you want me to say is there anything more do you want\n01:01:47 - anything other than God there these new ice creams which have come now Twix ice cream I promise you that it is so beautiful\n01:01:59 - that in the penultimate stage you can still keep your desire I tasted a Twist Twix ice cream one of my wellwishers brought it to me it was very close to a Heavenly\n01:02:11 - experience not the ultimate finality but to a Heavenly experience you can have all these things but that is the ultimate what is that by knowing which I may know all God is that by knowing\n01:02:24 - which you may know all God is that the isness of the 0 not Z so we in our in my teachings I don't say God and iswar and all this I just say the\n01:02:47 - reality and it's a it's and you are relativity so it's a constant urge a constant yearning for relativity to be in reality\n01:02:59 - relativity I I just wrote I mean ha Stephen Hawkins said that you don't need God for creation and I'm saying that relativity cannot exist with without reality just as the waves no matter how\n01:03:15 - high cannot exist without the ocean so also relativity and creation cannot exist without the ocean which is reality the waves cannot exist without the ocean so also relativity and creation cannot\n01:03:29 - exist without reality I hope you're convinced because everybody has been to the ocean and they know that they are the waves everybody is excited about the waves and they get\n01:03:50 - lost in these waves the tube wave the tunnel wave you know the high wave but in that excitement they forget the ocean who is the underlying factor of all surfing and all\n01:04:08 - waves so you have to Surf into the Stillness which is the underlying Factor would you like another question I want a cup of tea don't next time I shouldn't have to shout it out you must\n01:04:29 - get it immediately and get me a better cup it's a JY Banky cup get let let me have this now I'm used to a cup and sauce so this I don't drink in this give it to me here\n01:04:42 - yes ask the question uh so uh push shang's wife husband husband sorry uh he asks how do you surrender no who is this push shangi husband so Bang's husband yes\n01:04:60 - P yeah Foster City yeah so he asks how do you surrender when your ego is too strong and doesn't let you fully surrender if your ego is too strong and\n01:05:17 - doesn't let you fully surrender there will come a time where such an incident will happen uh in the outer World which will humble you you either get a thrashing or you you'll\n01:05:29 - get kicked out of your seat or somebody will in a debate he will defeat you so all egos have a fall everybody either they learn by their own practice and effort or they taught by the outer world\n01:05:45 - so be prepared for one or the other that's the way of the world those are the Cadian rhythms of the world either you go with the Cadian Rhythm flow\n01:05:57 - or you go against it and bear the results it is simple if you cannot do it if your ego is so strong life will teach you a\n01:06:10 - lesson it's nothing I've seen very very egotistic people people and I met them after 5 years they become humble because one one had a TST with his Destiny one one fellow got out of a\n01:06:24 - a bout of of a terrible cancer some fellow got some ganger or something so when they have all these things they nature humbles you and especially the rounds of Saturn that\n01:06:37 - they say the S Sati the S and a half year round of Kronos or Saturn and instead of making you say hey and you and being rude it makes you say Sir to your colleague you say Sir because it's\n01:06:52 - battered you and pattered it's payed you so much that you become one of the finest PES well ground and well humbled and good to taste all of you have been through that\n01:07:04 - experience when you go through a tough time the most arrogant of people have become so sweet and humble because Nature has kicked them around so don't worry one thing or the\n01:07:22 - other will help you you must give me tell me when the I have to start with the initiation you must tell me when the open is over I wish it\n01:07:47 - now so thank you for joining us from YouTube please uh follow the link if you wish to join the Kaa yog empowerment and uh that will start",
